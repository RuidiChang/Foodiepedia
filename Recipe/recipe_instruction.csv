panade,Cut or tear sourdough into rough 1-inch cubes. Set aside.
panade,"You can prepare these a day or two in advance if you like. You‰Ûªll need a large, wide skillet, pan or pot. Place the onions in the pan, drizzle with 1/4 cup of the olive oil and set over medium-high heat. Stir well and season with a couple pinches of salt. They‰Ûªll cook down. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions start to color and begin to caramelize. I like to let them get super jammy, with lots of color, but not-at all burned. This can take about a half hour. Once you‰Ûªre nearly done cooking the onions, reduce the heat to low and stir in the garlic. Cook until soft, 5-6 minutes. You should end up with 2 or 2 1/2 cups of cooked onions. Set aside."
panade,Preheat the oven to 325F.
panade,Place the bread cubes in a large bowl drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 1/2 cup of the broth. Add 1 cup of the scallions and a few pinches of salt. Use your hands to toss and gently squeeze the bread cubes until evenly moist. Set aside.
panade,"Choose an oven-proof 3-quart dutch oven or cast-iron pan or pot (12-cup capacity). See photos. Also note, you‰Ûªre going to want a baking dish that can go from stove-top to oven. Assemble the panade in layers. Start with a layer of onions, followed by a loose layer of bread cubes, another layer of onions, and then a layer of grated cheese. Repeat: bread, onions, cheese, until you‰Ûªve reached the top of your pan. Aim for 2-3 layers of each component, packing down with a bit of pressure if needed. The top layer should have a some of everything. Add a finishing sprinkle of the remaining scallions and the chives. Drizzle with remaining 2 T. olive oil."
panade,"Bring the remaining 4 1/2 cups of broth to a simmer and taste for seasoning, it should taste good enough to drink. Pour it slowly over the panade, in doses, around the edges until it comes up nearly to the rim. Let it sit for a minute, allowing the bread to absorb the broth and add a bit more if needed."
panade,"Set the panade over low heat and bring to a simmer. Look for bubbling at the edges and listen to know. Remove from heat. Cover with a layer of parchment paper, then loosely wrap the top and sides of the pan with foil, careful because the pan can be hot. Place another piece of foil or sheet pan on the rack below your panade in case it bubbles over. Bake for about an hour, before having a peek. Baking time will actually depend on your pan and oven - it can take longer. Take a peek, at this point the top should be getting a bit golden around the edges. If you‰Ûªre not seeing any color, bake longer."
panade,"Uncover the panade, dial your oven to 375F, and bake until beautiful and golden on top, another 15-25 minutes. I sometimes give it a finishing kiss with the broiler if I‰Ûªm not getting enough browning for my taste."
panade,"If you‰Ûªre not ready to serve, re-cover the panade, reduce the oven back to 250F, and you can hold it there for a half an hour or so without issue. You can always test the panade. Basically you want to avoid dryness. Your panade should be silky and unctuous. If it seems a bit on the dry side you can add more hot broth a few tablespoons at a time and serve when ready."
panade,Serve in pan after allowing to sit outside the oven for 10 minutes.

beet-fettuccine,"You can make the dough in a bowl, or directly on a countertop. If you start in a bowl, you'll end up turning out the dough onto a counter for kneading later. So! Start by combining the flours. Add the egg, and work it into the flour a bit. Add the beet juice, and stir to combine. Gradually add the water a splash at a time, you only want to use enough to get the dough to come together into a dryish mass. If you're not already working on a counter, turn the dough out and start kneading. You can add a bit more water now and then, if the dough is too dry. Knead for 7-10 minutes, just really go for it, until the pasta dough is silky and cohesive. Wrap tightly in plastic, or place in a sandwich bag for at least 30 minutes."
beet-fettuccine,"At this point either roll the pasta out thinly with a rolling pin or pasta machine (I go to 3 on the Atlas). You'll need a well-floured surface if you're rolling the dough out by hand, and you'll want to keep the pasta nicely floured as well, so it doesn't stick to itself. To cut the dough into fettuccine, loosely fold/roll the dough into a cylinder, and cut with a sharp knife. Alternately, you can run the dough though the fettuccine cutter on your pasta machine."
beet-fettuccine,"Cook in lots of well-salted boiling water for just a minute, these noodles cook quickly! Use in your favorite broth, or toss with your favorite sauce."

golden-crusted-brussels-sprouts,Wash the brussels sprouts well. Trim the stem ends and remove any raggy outer leaves. Cut in half from stem to top and toss in a bowl with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil.
golden-crusted-brussels-sprouts,"Heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil in your largest skillet over medium heat. Don't overheat the skillet, or the outsides of the sprouts will cook too quickly. Place the brussels sprouts in the pan flat side down (single-layer), sprinkle with a couple pinches of salt, cover, and cook for roughly 5 minutes; the bottoms of the sprouts should only show a hint of browning. Cut into or taste one of the sprouts to gauge whether they're tender throughout. If not, cover and cook for a few more minutes."
golden-crusted-brussels-sprouts,"Once just tender, uncover, turn up the heat, and cook until the flat sides are deep brown and caramelized. Use a metal spatula to toss them once or twice to get some browning on the rounded side. Season with more salt, a few grinds of pepper, and a dusting of grated cheese (or nuts). While you might be able to get away with keeping a platter of these warm in the oven for a few minutes, they are exponentially tastier if popped in your mouth immediately."

chipotle-baked-beans,"Drain and rinse the beans after their overnight soak. Then place them in a large saucepan and cover with an inch or two of water. Bring to a boil and simmer until the beans are cooked through and just tender. This can take anywhere from an hour to two hours (potentially more) depending on your beans, but do your best to avoid overcooking. Remove from heat, salt the beans (still in bean broth) with about a tablespoon of salt - enough that the bean liquid is tasty but on the salty side. Let the beans sit like this for ten minutes or so before draining and setting the beans aside."
chipotle-baked-beans,"In the meantime, place the 2 tablespoons olive oil, red pepper flakes, couple pinches of salt, and chopped garlic into a cold medium saucepan. Stir while you heat the saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute just 45 seconds or so until everything is fragrant - you don't want the garlic to brown. Stir in the tomatoes and the fresh oregano and heat to a gentle simmer, this takes just a couple minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the adobo sauce - carefully take a taste (you don't want to burn your tongue)...If the sauce needs more salt add it now, more chipotle flavor? Go for it. Set aside."

best-lasagna,"Thin out your pasta using a pasta machine. Start by cutting the big sheets into 2-inch(ish) wide ribbons. This usually means making 2 cuts along the sheets. This should yield you about 12 2-foot strips. Run them through the pasta machine. I go to the 7 setting, two shy of the very thinnest setting. The sheets should almost be translucent. Cut the strips into manageable rectangles roughly 4-inches in length."
best-lasagna,"To pre-cook the pasta, fill a large bowl with ice cold water and a few glugs of olive oil. Place a large flour sack or cotton dish towel across one of your counters. Salt your pot of boiling water generously. Ok, now you are ready to boil off your pasta. Believe it or not, you are on the home stretch. Place a handful of the pasta rectangles into the boiling water to cook (I've found I can get away with about 20 at a time), fish them out (I use a spider) after just 15-20 seconds, don't over cook. Transfer them immediately to the cold olive-oil water for a quick swim and cool-off. Remove from the cold water bath and place flat and neat on the cotton towel. It is ok for them to overlap, I don't have a problem with the sheets sticking typically. Repeat until all your pasta is boiled."
best-lasagna,"Ladle a bit of the sauce into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Cover the bottom with a layer of pasta sheets. Now a thin layer of sauce, and a bit of cheese. Go for another layer of pasta, then sauce, then pasta again, then sauce and cheese. Keep going until you've used up all the sauce and pasta. You want to finish with a layer of pasta. Top with the last of the sauce and the very last of the cheese so you have a nice cheesy top."

olive-oil-cake,"Bake for about 40 minutes, or until the top is domed, golden brown, and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. My cake, in the alternate pan, took closer to 50 minutes. Also, just when my cake was nearly finished baking, I decided I wanted a bit more color on top. I finished it under the broiler for a minute - which caramelized the sugar on top as well and gave it a bit of crunch. Don't walk away from the cake while it is under the broiler."

gnocchi-recipe,"Fill a large pot with cold water. Salt the water, then cut potatoes in half and place them in the pot. Bring the water to a boil and cook the potatoes until tender throughout, this takes roughly 40-50 minutes."
gnocchi-recipe,"Remove the potatoes from the water one at a time with a slotted spoon. Place each potato piece on a large cutting board and peel it before moving on to the next potato. Save the potato water. Also, peel each potato as soon as possible after removing from the water (without burning yourself) - I've found a paring knife comes in handy here. Be mindful that you want to work relatively quickly so you can mash the potatoes when they are hot. To do this you can either push the potatoes through a ricer, or do what I do, deconstruct them one at a time on the cutting board using the tines of a fork - mash isn't quite the right term here. I run the fork down the sides of the peeled potato creating a nice, fluffy potato base to work with (see photo). Don't over-mash - you are simply after an even consistency with no noticeable lumps."
gnocchi-recipe,Let the potatoes cool spread out across the cutting board - ten or fifteen minutes. Long enough that the egg won't cook when it is incorporated into the potatoes.
gnocchi-recipe,"When you're ready, pull the potatoes into a soft mound. Drizzle with the beaten egg and sprinkle 3/4 cup of the flour across the top. I've found that a metal spatula or large pastry scraper are both great utensils to use to incorporate the flour and eggs into the potatoes with the egg incorporated throughout - you can see the hint of yellow from the yolk. Scrape underneath and fold, scrape and fold until the mixture is a light crumble. Very gently, with a feathery touch knead the dough. This is also the point you can add more flour (a sprinkle at a time) if the dough is too tacky. I usually end up using most of the remaining 1/4 cup flour, but it all depends on the potatoes, the flour, the time of year, the weather, and whether the gnocchi gods are smiling on you. The dough should be moist but not sticky. It should feel almost billowy.åÊ"
gnocchi-recipe,"Cut it into 8 pieces. Now gently roll each 1/8th of dough into a snake-shaped log, roughly the thickness of your thumb. Use a knife to cut pieces every 3/4-inch (see photo). Dust with a bit more flour."
gnocchi-recipe,"To shape the gnocchi hold a fork in one hand (see photo) and place a gnocchi pillow against the tines of the fork (or gnocchi board), cut ends out. With confidence and an assertive (but very light) touch, use your thumb and press in and down the length of the fork. The gnocchi should curl into a slight ""C"" shape, their backs will capture the impression of the tines as tiny ridges (good for catching sauce later). Set each gnocchi aside, dust with a bit more flour if needed, until you are ready to boil them. This step takes some practice, don't get discouraged, once you get the hang of it it's easy."
gnocchi-recipe,"Now that you're on the final stretch, either reheat your potato water or start with a fresh pot (salted), and bring to a boil. Cook the gnocchi in batches by dropping them into the boiling water roughly twenty at a time. They will let you know when they are cooked because they will pop back up to the top. Fish them out of the water a few at a time with a slotted spoon ten seconds or so after they've surfaced. Have a large platter ready with a generous swirl of whatever sauce or favorite pesto you'll be serving on the gnocchi. Place the gnocchi on the platter. Continue cooking in batches until all the gnocchi are done. Gently toss with more sauce or pesto (don't overdo it, it should be a light dressing), and serve immediately, family-style with a drizzle of good olive oil on top."

Use a fork to break up the eggs without breaking through the walls of your mound. You want to try to keep the eggs contained, but don‰Ûªt worry if they break through - use a spatula or bench scraper to scoop them back in. Work more and more flour into the eggs a bit at a time. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of cold water across the mixture and keep mixing until you‰Ûªve got a dough coming together. If you‰Ûªre exclusively using all-purpose flour, you might not need more water. Some of the other flours are a bit thirstier, you can drizzle a bit more at time as you go if you feel like your dough is too dry.

To cut the dough into fettuccine by hand, loosely fold/roll the dough into a cylinder, and cut with a sharp knife. Alternately, you can run the dough though the fettuccine cutter on your pasta machine."

Dust with more flour, a tablespoon at a time, if your dough is too wet or tacky. Sometimes I need up to 1/4 cup more flour at this point. Knead for five minutes or so. I like to hold my bench scraper in one hand at this stage, to scrape the dough from the counter when it sticks. When you‰Ûªre done kneading, transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, and cover with a clean towel or plastic wrap. Place in a cozy or sunny spot. Allow to rise and double in size - usually between an hour or two."
braided-onion-bread,"Use your hand and gently press to deflate the dough. Turn out onto a floured surface, and roll the dough out into a rectangle roughly 12-inches wide and 16-inches long. Cut the dough lengthwise into strips 3-inches wide with a pizza cutter or knife. You‰Ûªll have four strips. Divide the filling into four equal portions (roughly 1/2 cup each), and spread a portion of it down just the center of each of the four strips, leaving the edges clear. Fold each strip in half and pinch to seal the filling in all the way down the length of each strip. At this point you should have 4 ‰ÛÏtubes‰Û of filled dough, and it‰Ûªs time to braid!"
braided-onion-bread,"Quickly and assertively transfer the strips to your parchment lined baking sheet a couple inches apart. Ideally, they‰Ûªll be seam side down. Now, this part can get a bit crazy, don‰Ûªt get flustered. If the strips stretch out, don‰Ûªt panic. If they‰Ûªre longer than the pan, don‰Ûªt sweat it. Just keep going. You‰Ûªre going to braid and coil the dough, so most of the mistakes you make don‰Ûªt really matter! Pinch the four strands together at the top, and start to braid."
braided-onion-bread,"Take a look at my sketch up above for more clarification, if needed. Take the left strand and move it over two strands (to the right) and under one strand back to the left. Switch to the other side: take the most right strand and lift it over two strands to the left and back under one strand to the right. Repeat, alternating from left side to right side until the loaf is complete. I find it easiest to say out loud, ‰ÛÏover two under one, over two under one.‰Û Pinch the ends together. Now, use your hands to coax the braid into a coil, like a snail shell. The fuller, top of the braid should be the center, and then keep wrapping around until you reach the end. Tuck the end under. It should be fairly snug. Cover loosely and allow to double in a cozy spot - usually 30 minutes to an hour. While you‰Ûªre waiting, preheat your oven to 350F with a rack in the center."
braided-onion-bread,"Last step is to glaze your bread! Whisk the egg yolk with 2 tablespoons of water. Brush the dough completely with the glaze and sprinkle with the remaining sesame seeds. Bake until the bread is beautifully golden, and cooked through, roughly 35-40 minutes. To be extra sure, I use a thermometer to make sure the dough in the center reaches about 190F, and then you know you‰Ûªre a-ok. Transfer to a baking rack to cool. Enjoy!"

how-to-make-ghee,"To make ghee, gently melt the butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. After melting, the butter will separate into three layers. This should only take a few minutes. Foam will appear on the top layer, the milk solids will migrate to the bottom of the pan, and clarified butter will float between the two.åÊ"

Middle-tray: equal sized pieces of broccoli, cauliflower.åÊTop-tray/last minute: asparagus, fava beans (inner pods), snap peas."
steaming-vegetables,"Bring an inch of water to a simmer in a skillet large enough to accommodate the diameter of your steamer. Alternately, you can use a wok. The water should not be so high that it makes contact with the vegetables when the steamer is placed in the skillet - do a quick test if you're unsure, and remove some water if needed."
steaming-vegetables,"The goal here is to have your vegetables perfectly cooked and ready to serve just before you sit down. And, ideally, all of the vegetables finish cooking at the same time. Here's how you do it. Roughly ten minutes before you're ready to serve, place the slow-cooking, bottom tray vegetables over the simmering water, covered. Let them steam there until they're about 2/3 cooked, about 6-7 minutes. Test, and cut into any root vegetables toward the end to make sure they're going to be cooked through."
steaming-vegetables,"The mid tray only needs 3-4 minutes, so add that next, moving the lid up a level. And the top tray vegetables, like snap peas and asparagus, just need a kiss of steam to brighten, barely a minute. Add that last.

If you‰Ûªre used to the typical food processor tart dough method, this is going to be different, but the resulting texture is so much better - flaky perfection. If the instructions are at all confusingåÊyou can watch the method here. I learned the technique from Pim years ago and never looked back. Also, you don‰Ûªt have to wash a food processor = less dishes. To start, mix the flours, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and quinoa in a bowl and turn out onto the counter. Working quickly, cut the butter into four long slabs and arrange in a single layer across the surface of the flour. Hold a bench scraper (or wide metal spatula) in one hand, and use the palm of your other hand to smear the butter into the flour. Use the bench scraper to scrape the smeared flour-butter off the counter and back up into the pile. Use your palm to smear some more, scrape, and repeat. You want lots of feathery flakes throughout the flour. Drizzle the mixture with the ice water and smear, flip, and mix a few more times to bring it all together into a ball. Decide how many tarts you‰Ûªd like to bake, and cut into that many equal pieces (1, 2, or 4). Shape into balls, press into discs, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 45 minutes or over night. You can also double wrap and freeze for up to a month or so at this point, thaw before using."
tomato-tart,"When you‰Ûªre ready to assemble your tart(s), preheat the oven to 400F with a rack in the center.  Roll your dough out into a 1/8-inch thick circle shape on a floured surface, it doesn't have to be perfect. Transfer the rolled out dough to a piece of parchment paper. Arrange a generous amount of the onions in the center of your tart(s) leaving an inch-ish of border. Cover the onions with overlapping sliced tomatoes, then fold the tart dough in toward the filling, over lapping it just a bit. Brush any visible pasty with the beaten egg.

I like to separate the beans from the broth at this point. Be sure to keep the broth."
refried-beans,"When you‰Ûªre ready, mash the beans. You can use a potato or bean masher if you have one. Or a pestle, or big fork. Really go for it. You want some pasty action, and some chunky parts.

Be sure you get all the avocado near the skin, it's the best part. Sprinkle the avocado with the onions and garlic, and use a large fork to fold everything together.

how-to-cook-artichokes,"Fill a bowl with water, squeeze the juice of the lemon into it. You'll add the artichokes to the water immediately after trimming."
how-to-cook-artichokes,"To trim your artichokes: Actually, before I get into the details of trimming, let's just establish what we're after. We're after the tender. Meaning, we want to trim any tough outer leaves, tips, and stem. We want to get down to the tender parts of the leaves, without trimming so much that we have little left. To start, trim the stem. Pull the outer leaves from the artichoke, until you get down to the more tender leaves. Cut off the top of the artichoke (roughly where it begins to taper in), you want to remove the tough part of the tips. I like to use a serrated knife for that cut. From here decide what shape you'd like your artichoke pieces to be. For this preparation, I cut each artichoke in halves, and/or quarters. If you are using larger artichokes, ones that have developed a fuzzy choke, you'll need to use a teaspoon (or mellon baller) to carve the fuzz out before moving on to your final cuts. Work efficiently, and get the trimmed artichokes in the lemon water as quickly as possible to reduce browning from oxidation."
how-to-cook-artichokes,"While prepping the artichokes, bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Salt well, and use a slotted spoon to transfer them from the lemon water to the boiling water. Boil until just tender, typically a minute or two. Drain well, and set aside. Alternately, you can steam the artichokes - this will keep more of the nutrients intact. Either way, you want the artichokes to be cooked tender (and feel free to eat them at this point)!"

celery-salt,"Pick the leaves from each celery stalk, leaving the stems behind. The outer leaves tend to be dark green and hearty, the inner leaves pale green and tender. I use them all."
celery-salt,"Rinse the leaves with cold water in a strainer, then shake off as much of the water as you can. At this point you want to dry the leaves as much as possible, so they toast (not steam) when you cook them. Gently pat them dry in a clean dish towel, or paper towels. Once dry you have two options for toasting the leaves."
celery-salt,"If I have a lot of leaves, I arrange them in a single layer on a baking sheet, then bake in a 350F / 180C oven for about 5-7 minutes. Bake until dehydrated and crispy, but not browned."
celery-salt,"If I have fewer leaves, or just don't feel like heating the oven, I'll throw them in a large skillet. Single layer if possible, over medium-low heat. Again, you want to barely toast them, not brown the leaves much."
celery-salt,"In either case, when you're done cooking. Remove from heat and let the leaves cool completely. They'll crisp up even more at this point. When cool, use your fingers to crumble the leaves completely, discarding any leaves that aren't crispy."

best-pizza-dough-ever,"Stir together the flour, salt, and instant yeast in a 4-quart bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). With a large metal spoon, stir in the oil and the cold water until the flour is all absorbed (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment), If you are mixing by hand, repeatedly dip one of your hands or the metal spoon into cold water and use it, much like a dough hook, to work the dough vigorously into a smooth mass while rotating the bowl in a circular motion with the other hand. Reverse the circular motion a few times to develop the gluten further. Do this for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and the ingredients are evenly distributed. If you are using an electric mixer, switch to the dough hook and mix on medium speed for 5 to 7 minutes, or as long as it takes to create a smooth, sticky dough. The dough should clear the sides of the bowl but stick to the bottom of the bowl. If the dough is too wet and doesn't come off the sides of the bowl, sprinkle in some more flour just until it clears the sides. If it clears the bottom of the bowl, dribble in a teaspoon or two of cold water. The finished dough will be springy, elastic, and sticky, not just tacky, and register 50 to 55F."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"Sprinkle flour on the counter and transfer the dough to the counter. Prepare a sheet pan by lining it with baking parchment and misting the parchment with spray oil (or lightly oil the parchment). Using a metal dough scraper, cut the dough into 6 equal pieces (or larger if you are comfortable shaping large pizzas), You can dip the scraper into the water between cuts to keep the dough from sticking to it, Sprinkle flour over the dough. Make sure your hands are dry and then flour them. Lift each piece and gently round it into a ball. If the dough sticks to your hands, dip your hands into the flour again. Transfer the dough balls to the sheet pan, Mist the dough generously with spray oil and slip the pan into a food-grade plastic bag."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"Put the pan into the refrigerator overnight to rest the dough, or keep for up to 3 days. (Note: If you want to save some of the dough for future baking, you can store the dough balls in a zippered freezer bag. Dip each dough ball into a bowl that has a few tablespoons of oil in it, rolling the dough in the oil, and then put each ball into a separate bag. You can place the bags into the freezer for up to 3 months. Transfer them to the refrigerator the day before you plan to make pizza.)"
best-pizza-dough-ever,"On the day you plan to make the pizza, remove the desired number of dough balls from the refrigerator 2 hours before making the pizza. Before letting the dough rest at room temperature for 2 hours, dust the counter with flour, and then mist the counter with spray oil. Place the dough balls on top of the floured counter and sprinkle them with flour; dust your hands with flour. Gently press the dough into flat disks about 1/2 inch thick and 5 inches in diameter. Sprinkle the dough with flour, mist it again with spray oil, and cover the dough loosely with plastic wrap or a food-grade plastic bag. Now let rest for 2 hours."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"At least 45 minutes before making the pizza, place a baking stone either on the floor of the oven (for gas ovens), or on a rack in the lower third of the oven. Heat the oven as hot as possible, up to 800F (most home ovens will go only to 500 to 550F, but some will go higher). If you do not have a baking stone, you can use the back of a sheet pan, but do not preheat the pan."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"Generously dust a peel or the back of a sheet pan with semolina flour or cornmeal. Make the pizzas one at a time. Dip your hands, including the backs of your hands and knuckles, in flour and lift I piece of dough by getting under it with a pastry scraper. Very gently lay the dough across your fists and carefully stretch it by bouncing the dough in a circular motion on your hands, carefully giving it a little stretch with each bounce. If it begins to stick to your hands, lay it down on the floured counter and reflour your hands, then continue shaping it. If you have trouble tossing the dough, or if the dough keeps springing back, let it rest for 5 to 20 minutes so the gluten can relax, and try again. You can also resort to using a rolling pin, though this isn't as effective."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"When the dough is stretched out to your satisfaction (about 9 to 12 inches in diameter for a 6-ounce piece of dough), lay it on the peel or pan, making sure there is enough semolina flour or cornmeal to allow it to slide. Lightly top it with sauce and then with your other toppings, remembering that the best pizzas are topped with a less-is-more philosophy. The American ""kitchen sink"" approach is counterproductive, as it makes the crust more difficult to bake. A few, usually no more than 3 or 4 toppings, including sauce and cheese is sufficient."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"Slide the topped pizza onto the stone (or bake directly on the sheet pan) and close the door. Wait 2 minutes, then take a peek. If it needs to be rotated 180 degrees for even baking, do so. The pizza should take about 5 to 8 minutes to bake. If the top gets done before the bottom, you will need to move the stone to a lower self before the next round. if the bottom crisps before the cheese caramelizes, then you will need to raise the stone for subsequent bakes."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"Remove the pizza from the oven and transfer to a cutting board. Wait 3 to 5 minutes before slicing and serving, to allow the cheese to set slightly."

steaming-vegetables,"The goal here is to have your vegetables perfectly cooked and ready to serve just before you sit down. And, ideally, all of the vegetables finish cooking at the same time. Here's how you do it. Roughly ten minutes before you're ready to serve, place the slow-cooking, bottom tray vegetables over the simmering water, covered. Let them steam there until they're about 2/3 cooked, about 6-7 minutes. Test, and cut into any root vegetables toward the end to make sure they're going to be cooked through."

how-to-cook-artichokes,"To trim your artichokes: Actually, before I get into the details of trimming, let's just establish what we're after. We're after the tender. Meaning, we want to trim any tough outer leaves, tips, and stem. We want to get down to the tender parts of the leaves, without trimming so much that we have little left. To start, trim the stem. Pull the outer leaves from the artichoke, until you get down to the more tender leaves. Cut off the top of the artichoke (roughly where it begins to taper in), you want to remove the tough part of the tips. I like to use a serrated knife for that cut. From here decide what shape you'd like your artichoke pieces to be. For this preparation, I cut each artichoke in halves, and/or quarters. If you are using larger artichokes, ones that have developed a fuzzy choke, you'll need to use a teaspoon (or mellon baller) to carve the fuzz out before moving on to your final cuts. Work efficiently, and get the trimmed artichokes in the lemon water as quickly as possible to reduce browning from oxidation."
how-to-cook-artichokes,"While prepping the artichokes, bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Salt well, and use a slotted spoon to transfer them from the lemon water to the boiling water. Boil until just tender, typically a minute or two. Drain well, and set aside. Alternately, you can steam the artichokes - this will keep more of the nutrients intact. Either way, you want the artichokes to be cooked tender (and feel free to eat them at this point)!"

snickerdoodle-cookies,"Preheat the oven to 350å¡F (175å¡C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Roll 1/4-cup (60 ml) portions of the dough into balls, and place them on the baking sheet, spacing them at least 2 inches (5 cm) apart. Bake for about 16 minutes, until golden but not too dark, rotating the pan midway through the baking time. Ideally, the baked cookies will be tall and slightly undercooked in the center, and will buckle shortly after coming out of the oven. If the cookies don't buckle, don't worry; they'll still be delicious. Let the cookies cool on the pan for 10 minutes before removing. These cookies are best when eaten warm, shortly after they come out of the oven. However, they can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. Alternatively, the dough can stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, so consider baking only as many cookies as needed and saving the rest of the dough to bake another day."

braided-onion-bread,Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
braided-onion-bread,"Start by making the filling. You can do this a day or two ahead of time, and refrigerate. Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat, and stir in the onions along with a generous pinch of salt. Saute, stirring regularly, until the onions get brown and caramelized - twenty minutes or so. Remove from heat, allow to cool, and then stir in the cheese and 1/4 cup of the sesame seeds. Set aside or refrigerate until ready to use. If you‰Ûªve cooked your filling ahead of time and refrigerated it, bring it back to room temperature before filling your dough."
braided-onion-bread,"To make the dough, combine 2 cups of the flour, the sugar, salt, and yeast in a medium bowl. Add the warm milk and stir just until you don‰Ûªt see any more dry flour. Add the egg and butter, and stir until it is all incorporated. Add the rest of the flour (the remaining 2 1/2 cups) and stir until you have a nice, soft dough."
braided-onion-bread,"Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until a cohesive, not-too-sticky dough forms. Dust with more flour, a tablespoon at a time, if your dough is too wet or tacky. Sometimes I need up to 1/4 cup more flour at this point. Knead for five minutes or so. I like to hold my bench scraper in one hand at this stage, to scrape the dough from the counter when it sticks. When you‰Ûªre done kneading, transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, and cover with a clean towel or plastic wrap. Place in a cozy or sunny spot. Allow to rise and double in size - usually between an hour or two."
braided-onion-bread,"Use your hand and gently press to deflate the dough. Turn out onto a floured surface, and roll the dough out into a rectangle roughly 12-inches wide and 16-inches long. Cut the dough lengthwise into strips 3-inches wide with a pizza cutter or knife. You‰Ûªll have four strips. Divide the filling into four equal portions (roughly 1/2 cup each), and spread a portion of it down just the center of each of the four strips, leaving the edges clear. Fold each strip in half and pinch to seal the filling in all the way down the length of each strip. At this point you should have 4 ‰ÛÏtubes‰Û of filled dough, and it‰Ûªs time to braid!"
braided-onion-bread,"Quickly and assertively transfer the strips to your parchment lined baking sheet a couple inches apart. Ideally, they‰Ûªll be seam side down. Now, this part can get a bit crazy, don‰Ûªt get flustered. If the strips stretch out, don‰Ûªt panic. If they‰Ûªre longer than the pan, don‰Ûªt sweat it. Just keep going. You‰Ûªre going to braid and coil the dough, so most of the mistakes you make don‰Ûªt really matter! Pinch the four strands together at the top, and start to braid."
braided-onion-bread,"Take a look at my sketch up above for more clarification, if needed. Take the left strand and move it over two strands (to the right) and under one strand back to the left. Switch to the other side: take the most right strand and lift it over two strands to the left and back under one strand to the right. Repeat, alternating from left side to right side until the loaf is complete. I find it easiest to say out loud, ‰ÛÏover two under one, over two under one.‰Û Pinch the ends together. Now, use your hands to coax the braid into a coil, like a snail shell. The fuller, top of the braid should be the center, and then keep wrapping around until you reach the end. Tuck the end under. It should be fairly snug. Cover loosely and allow to double in a cozy spot - usually 30 minutes to an hour. While you‰Ûªre waiting, preheat your oven to 350F with a rack in the center."
braided-onion-bread,"Last step is to glaze your bread! Whisk the egg yolk with 2 tablespoons of water. Brush the dough completely with the glaze and sprinkle with the remaining sesame seeds. Bake until the bread is beautifully golden, and cooked through, roughly 35-40 minutes. To be extra sure, I use a thermometer to make sure the dough in the center reaches about 190F, and then you know you‰Ûªre a-ok. Transfer to a baking rack to cool. Enjoy!"

Cover with a layer of parchment paper, then loosely wrap the top and sides of the pan with foil, careful because the pan can be hot. Place another piece of foil or sheet pan on the rack below your panade in case it bubbles over. Bake for about an hour, before having a peek. Baking time will actually depend on your pan and oven - it can take longer. Take a peek, at this point the top should be getting a bit golden around the edges. If you‰Ûªre not seeing any color, bake longer."

Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat, and stir in the onions along with a generous pinch of salt. Saute, stirring regularly, until the onions get brown and caramelized - twenty minutes or so. Remove from heat, allow to cool, and then stir in the cheese and 1/4 cup of the sesame seeds. Set aside or refrigerate until ready to use. If you‰Ûªve cooked your filling ahead of time and refrigerated it, bring it back to room temperature before filling your dough."
braided-onion-bread,"To make the dough, combine 2 cups of the flour, the sugar, salt, and yeast in a medium bowl. Add the warm milk and stir just until you don‰Ûªt see any more dry flour. Add the egg and butter, and stir until it is all incorporated. Add the rest of the flour (the remaining 2 1/2 cups) and stir until you have a nice, soft dough."
braided-onion-bread,"Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until a cohesive, not-too-sticky dough forms. Dust with more flour, a tablespoon at a time, if your dough is too wet or tacky. Sometimes I need up to 1/4 cup more flour at this point. Knead for five minutes or so. I like to hold my bench scraper in one hand at this stage, to scrape the dough from the counter when it sticks. When you‰Ûªre done kneading, transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, and cover with a clean towel or plastic wrap. Place in a cozy or sunny spot. Allow to rise and double in size - usually between an hour or two."
braided-onion-bread,"Use your hand and gently press to deflate the dough. Turn out onto a floured surface, and roll the dough out into a rectangle roughly 12-inches wide and 16-inches long. Cut the dough lengthwise into strips 3-inches wide with a pizza cutter or knife. You‰Ûªll have four strips. Divide the filling into four equal portions (roughly 1/2 cup each), and spread a portion of it down just the center of each of the four strips, leaving the edges clear. Fold each strip in half and pinch to seal the filling in all the way down the length of each strip. At this point you should have 4 ‰ÛÏtubes‰Û of filled dough, and it‰Ûªs time to braid!"
braided-onion-bread,"Quickly and assertively transfer the strips to your parchment lined baking sheet a couple inches apart. Ideally, they‰Ûªll be seam side down. Now, this part can get a bit crazy, don‰Ûªt get flustered. If the strips stretch out, don‰Ûªt panic. If they‰Ûªre longer than the pan, don‰Ûªt sweat it. Just keep going. You‰Ûªre going to braid and coil the dough, so most of the mistakes you make don‰Ûªt really matter! Pinch the four strands together at the top, and start to braid."
braided-onion-bread,"Take a look at my sketch up above for more clarification, if needed. Take the left strand and move it over two strands (to the right) and under one strand back to the left. Switch to the other side: take the most right strand and lift it over two strands to the left and back under one strand to the right. Repeat, alternating from left side to right side until the loaf is complete. I find it easiest to say out loud, ‰ÛÏover two under one, over two under one.‰Û Pinch the ends together. Now, use your hands to coax the braid into a coil, like a snail shell. The fuller, top of the braid should be the center, and then keep wrapping around until you reach the end. Tuck the end under. It should be fairly snug. Cover loosely and allow to double in a cozy spot - usually 30 minutes to an hour. While you‰Ûªre waiting, preheat your oven to 350F with a rack in the center."
braided-onion-bread,"Last step is to glaze your bread! Whisk the egg yolk with 2 tablespoons of water. Brush the dough completely with the glaze and sprinkle with the remaining sesame seeds. Bake until the bread is beautifully golden, and cooked through, roughly 35-40 minutes. To be extra sure, I use a thermometer to make sure the dough in the center reaches about 190F, and then you know you‰Ûªre a-ok. Transfer to a baking rack to cool. Enjoy!"

Sprinkle half of the sugar mixture evenly across the butter. Roll the dough up tightly lengthwise, then turn it so that the seam side is down. Cut the roll into 12 equal slices, a serrated knife works best. You can bake these, cut-side up, on a parchment lined baking sheet, in cupcake liners, or in a buttered baking dish. I used a well-buttered standard pie dish. Unless you are using individual cupcake liners, you want to arrange the slices about 1/2-inch from each other on the baking sheet or in the baking dish. They rise and expand, and end up nice and snuggly in/on the pan. Repeat with the remaining rectangle of dough and filling. You can freeze any slices you aren't going to bake at this point."

tomato-tart,"Start by caramelizing your onions. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, combine the onions, olive oil, and a few pinches of salt. Cook stirring regularly for 15-20 minutes or so, or until the onions are dark, deeply caramelized, and jammy in texture. Stir in the turmeric and black pepper, if using, remove from heat, and let cool. If you‰Ûªre making your tart immediately, cool the onions by spreading them across a large plate and placing in the refrigerator. Alternately, if you‰Ûªre baking the next day or two, transfer to a jar and refrigerate."
tomato-tart,"Next up is making the tart dough. If you‰Ûªre used to the typical food processor tart dough method, this is going to be different, but the resulting texture is so much better - flaky perfection. If the instructions are at all confusingåÊyou can watch the method here. I learned the technique from Pim years ago and never looked back. Also, you don‰Ûªt have to wash a food processor = less dishes. To start, mix the flours, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and quinoa in a bowl and turn out onto the counter. Working quickly, cut the butter into four long slabs and arrange in a single layer across the surface of the flour. Hold a bench scraper (or wide metal spatula) in one hand, and use the palm of your other hand to smear the butter into the flour. Use the bench scraper to scrape the smeared flour-butter off the counter and back up into the pile. Use your palm to smear some more, scrape, and repeat. You want lots of feathery flakes throughout the flour. Drizzle the mixture with the ice water and smear, flip, and mix a few more times to bring it all together into a ball. Decide how many tarts you‰Ûªd like to bake, and cut into that many equal pieces (1, 2, or 4). Shape into balls, press into discs, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 45 minutes or over night. You can also double wrap and freeze for up to a month or so at this point, thaw before using."
tomato-tart,"When you‰Ûªre ready to assemble your tart(s), preheat the oven to 400F with a rack in the center.  Roll your dough out into a 1/8-inch thick circle shape on a floured surface, it doesn't have to be perfect. Transfer the rolled out dough to a piece of parchment paper. Arrange a generous amount of the onions in the center of your tart(s) leaving an inch-ish of border. Cover the onions with overlapping sliced tomatoes, then fold the tart dough in toward the filling, over lapping it just a bit. Brush any visible pasty with the beaten egg. Transfer, on the parchment paper, to a baking sheet and bake for 25-30 minutes or until the crust is deeply golden."
tomato-tart,"Finish with any/all of the suggested ideas - a dusting of cheese, but of lemon zest, lots or basil, definitely go for a drizzle of good olive oil. I love to enjoy this immediately, but it will hold up for later, if needed."

steaming-vegetables,"Wash your vegetables well, and cut them into bite-sized pieces. I tend to leave peels on, but it is a personal preference. Arrange them, in a single layer, in steamer trays according to needed cooking time. For example:"
steaming-vegetables,"Bottom tray: equal-sized chunks of slower-cooking vegetables. For example: sweet potato, potato, winter squash, beets. These usually cook through in about ten minutes. Middle-tray: equal sized pieces of broccoli, cauliflower.åÊTop-tray/last minute: asparagus, fava beans (inner pods), snap peas."
steaming-vegetables,"Bring an inch of water to a simmer in a skillet large enough to accommodate the diameter of your steamer. Alternately, you can use a wok. The water should not be so high that it makes contact with the vegetables when the steamer is placed in the skillet - do a quick test if you're unsure, and remove some water if needed."
steaming-vegetables,"The goal here is to have your vegetables perfectly cooked and ready to serve just before you sit down. And, ideally, all of the vegetables finish cooking at the same time. Here's how you do it. Roughly ten minutes before you're ready to serve, place the slow-cooking, bottom tray vegetables over the simmering water, covered. Let them steam there until they're about 2/3 cooked, about 6-7 minutes. Test, and cut into any root vegetables toward the end to make sure they're going to be cooked through."
steaming-vegetables,"The mid tray only needs 3-4 minutes, so add that next, moving the lid up a level. And the top tray vegetables, like snap peas and asparagus, just need a kiss of steam to brighten, barely a minute. Add that last. Or if you only have two baskets, add these to the broccoli/cauliflower basket to finish. You'll have to make slight adjustments based on the sizes of your vegetables, but this is the general idea. Cook them until they're bright, just tender, and taste good to you."

how-to-cook-artichokes,"To trim your artichokes: Actually, before I get into the details of trimming, let's just establish what we're after. We're after the tender. Meaning, we want to trim any tough outer leaves, tips, and stem. We want to get down to the tender parts of the leaves, without trimming so much that we have little left. To start, trim the stem. Pull the outer leaves from the artichoke, until you get down to the more tender leaves. Cut off the top of the artichoke (roughly where it begins to taper in), you want to remove the tough part of the tips. I like to use a serrated knife for that cut. From here decide what shape you'd like your artichoke pieces to be. For this preparation, I cut each artichoke in halves, and/or quarters. If you are using larger artichokes, ones that have developed a fuzzy choke, you'll need to use a teaspoon (or mellon baller) to carve the fuzz out before moving on to your final cuts. Work efficiently, and get the trimmed artichokes in the lemon water as quickly as possible to reduce browning from oxidation."
how-to-cook-artichokes,"While prepping the artichokes, bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Salt well, and use a slotted spoon to transfer them from the lemon water to the boiling water. Boil until just tender, typically a minute or two. Drain well, and set aside. Alternately, you can steam the artichokes - this will keep more of the nutrients intact.

omelette-recipe,"In your largest non-stick skillet over medium heat (this is one of the few occasions I actually use non-stick) pour the egg mixture and give it a good swirl so that they spread out thinly across the entire pan. Alternately, you can use a crepe pan or crepe maker - this works beautifully as well. Sprinkle the eggs with some salt and some of the chives and let them set, this happens quickly depending on the heat of your pan - 15 seconds to one minute. Run a spatula underneath the omelette and slide it out of the pan (flat) onto a clean countertop, large cutting board or Silpat-lined cookie sheet. Do this with confidence (or practice).åÊ"

cinnamon-rolls,"Add the remaining sugar, the egg, melted butter, and cardamom. Stir until smooth. Stir the salt into the flour, then gradually add the flour to the bowl, a bit at a time, incorporating the flour after each addition. Transfer the dough to a floured counter top and knead for 8-10 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, turn it to coat with oil, and cover with a kitchen towel or equivalent. Let the dough rise in a sunny or warm place until doubled, about an hour."

cinnamon-rolls,"Start by combining the cinnamon and sugar in a small bowl. Spread half of the butter evenly over one rectangle of the dough. Sprinkle half of the sugar mixture evenly across the butter. Roll the dough up tightly lengthwise, then turn it so that the seam side is down. Cut the roll into 12 equal slices, a serrated knife works best. You can bake these, cut-side up, on a parchment lined baking sheet, in cupcake liners, or in a buttered baking dish. I used a well-buttered standard pie dish. Unless you are using individual cupcake liners, you want to arrange the slices about 1/2-inch from each other on the baking sheet or in the baking dish. They rise and expand, and end up nice and snuggly in/on the pan. Repeat with the remaining rectangle of dough and filling. You can freeze any slices you aren't going to bake at this point."

Stir the butter and sugar into the remaining cup of warm milk and add it to the yeast mixture. With a fork, stir in the eggs, flour, nutmeg, and salt - just until the flour is incorporated. With the dough hook attachment of your mixer beat the dough for a few minutes at medium speed. This is where you are going to need to make adjustments - if your dough is overly sticky, add flour a few tablespoons at a time. Too dry? Add more milk a bit at a time. You want the dough to pull away from the sides of the mixing bowl and eventually become supple and smooth. Turn it out onto a floured counter-top, knead a few times (the dough should be barely sticky), and shape into a ball."

perfect-healthy-granola-recipe,"Transfer the granola onto your baking sheet. Rub your hands with a bit of olive oil, and pat the mixture into a thin, solid, single layer.

Stir one more time, assess, and (possibly) bake for another 5-10 minutes. Keep a close eye on the whole baking process, the granola can burn in a flash, and it‰Ûªs hard to see it toasting because it is so dark from the cocoa. The key is knowing when to pull the granola from the oven. You need to go long enough to get crunchy granola in the end, pull it too soon, and your granola will still be tasty, but will lack crunch."

perfect-healthy-granola-recipe,"In a large bowl combine the rolled oats, cocoa, seeds, quinoa crisps (optional), cacao nibs, and salt. Use an electric mixer on high speed to whip the aquafaba into floppy peaks. This can take five minutes or so. Use a spatula to gently fold in the olive oil, honey, and vanilla extract. Pour this mixture over the dry ingredients, and fold into a uniform mass."
perfect-healthy-granola-recipe,"Transfer the granola onto your baking sheet. Rub your hands with a bit of olive oil, and pat the mixture into a thin, solid, single layer. Really try to get it as thin as possible, this will result in the best crunchy texture after baking. Bake for 15 minutes, stir, pat down again, and bake for another 15 minutes. Stir one more time, assess, and (possibly) bake for another 5-10 minutes. Keep a close eye on the whole baking process, the granola can burn in a flash, and it‰Ûªs hard to see it toasting because it is so dark from the cocoa. The key is knowing when to pull the granola from the oven. You need to go long enough to get crunchy granola in the end, pull it too soon, and your granola will still be tasty, but will lack crunch."
perfect-healthy-granola-recipe,"Remove from the oven and stir in the coconut flakes. Allow to cool completely before serving or storing, this can take an hour or two. Store in air-tight glass jars to keep the granola crunchy."

panade,Cut or tear sourdough into rough 1-inch cubes. Set aside.
panade,"You can prepare these a day or two in advance if you like. You‰Ûªll need a large, wide skillet, pan or pot. Place the onions in the pan, drizzle with 1/4 cup of the olive oil and set over medium-high heat. Stir well and season with a couple pinches of salt. They‰Ûªll cook down. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions start to color and begin to caramelize. I like to let them get super jammy, with lots of color, but not-at all burned. This can take about a half hour. Once you‰Ûªre nearly done cooking the onions, reduce the heat to low and stir in the garlic. Cook until soft, 5-6 minutes. You should end up with 2 or 2 1/2 cups of cooked onions. Set aside."
panade,Preheat the oven to 325F.
panade,Place the bread cubes in a large bowl drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 1/2 cup of the broth. Add 1 cup of the scallions and a few pinches of salt. Use your hands to toss and gently squeeze the bread cubes until evenly moist. Set aside.
panade,"Choose an oven-proof 3-quart dutch oven or cast-iron pan or pot (12-cup capacity). See photos. Also note, you‰Ûªre going to want a baking dish that can go from stove-top to oven. Assemble the panade in layers. Start with a layer of onions, followed by a loose layer of bread cubes, another layer of onions, and then a layer of grated cheese. Repeat: bread, onions, cheese, until you‰Ûªve reached the top of your pan. Aim for 2-3 layers of each component, packing down with a bit of pressure if needed. The top layer should have a some of everything. Add a finishing sprinkle of the remaining scallions and the chives. Drizzle with remaining 2 T. olive oil."
panade,"Bring the remaining 4 1/2 cups of broth to a simmer and taste for seasoning, it should taste good enough to drink. Pour it slowly over the panade, in doses, around the edges until it comes up nearly to the rim. Let it sit for a minute, allowing the bread to absorb the broth and add a bit more if needed."
panade,"Set the panade over low heat and bring to a simmer. Look for bubbling at the edges and listen to know. Remove from heat. Cover with a layer of parchment paper, then loosely wrap the top and sides of the pan with foil, careful because the pan can be hot. Place another piece of foil or sheet pan on the rack below your panade in case it bubbles over. Bake for about an hour, before having a peek. Baking time will actually depend on your pan and oven - it can take longer. Take a peek, at this point the top should be getting a bit golden around the edges. If you‰Ûªre not seeing any color, bake longer."
panade,"Uncover the panade, dial your oven to 375F, and bake until beautiful and golden on top, another 15-25 minutes. I sometimes give it a finishing kiss with the broiler if I‰Ûªm not getting enough browning for my taste."
panade,"If you‰Ûªre not ready to serve, re-cover the panade, reduce the oven back to 250F, and you can hold it there for a half an hour or so without issue. You can always test the panade. Basically you want to avoid dryness. Your panade should be silky and unctuous. If it seems a bit on the dry side you can add more hot broth a few tablespoons at a time and serve when ready."
panade,Serve in pan after allowing to sit outside the oven for 10 minutes.

beet-fettuccine,"You can make the dough in a bowl, or directly on a countertop. If you start in a bowl, you'll end up turning out the dough onto a counter for kneading later. So! Start by combining the flours. Add the egg, and work it into the flour a bit. Add the beet juice, and stir to combine. Gradually add the water a splash at a time, you only want to use enough to get the dough to come together into a dryish mass. If you're not already working on a counter, turn the dough out and start kneading. You can add a bit more water now and then, if the dough is too dry. Knead for 7-10 minutes, just really go for it, until the pasta dough is silky and cohesive. Wrap tightly in plastic, or place in a sandwich bag for at least 30 minutes."
beet-fettuccine,"At this point either roll the pasta out thinly with a rolling pin or pasta machine (I go to 3 on the Atlas). You'll need a well-floured surface if you're rolling the dough out by hand, and you'll want to keep the pasta nicely floured as well, so it doesn't stick to itself. To cut the dough into fettuccine, loosely fold/roll the dough into a cylinder, and cut with a sharp knife. Alternately, you can run the dough though the fettuccine cutter on your pasta machine."

best-lasagna,"Thin out your pasta using a pasta machine. Start by cutting the big sheets into 2-inch(ish) wide ribbons. This usually means making 2 cuts along the sheets. This should yield you about 12 2-foot strips. Run them through the pasta machine. I go to the 7 setting, two shy of the very thinnest setting. The sheets should almost be translucent. Cut the strips into manageable rectangles roughly 4-inches in length."
best-lasagna,"To pre-cook the pasta, fill a large bowl with ice cold water and a few glugs of olive oil. Place a large flour sack or cotton dish towel across one of your counters. Salt your pot of boiling water generously. Ok, now you are ready to boil off your pasta. Believe it or not, you are on the home stretch. Place a handful of the pasta rectangles into the boiling water to cook (I've found I can get away with about 20 at a time), fish them out (I use a spider) after just 15-20 seconds, don't over cook. Transfer them immediately to the cold olive-oil water for a quick swim and cool-off. Remove from the cold water bath and place flat and neat on the cotton towel. It is ok for them to overlap, I don't have a problem with the sheets sticking typically. Repeat until all your pasta is boiled."
best-lasagna,"Ladle a bit of the sauce into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Cover the bottom with a layer of pasta sheets. Now a thin layer of sauce, and a bit of cheese. Go for another layer of pasta, then sauce, then pasta again, then sauce and cheese. Keep going until you've used up all the sauce and pasta. You want to finish with a layer of pasta. Top with the last of the sauce and the very last of the cheese so you have a nice cheesy top."

panade,"You can prepare these a day or two in advance if you like. You‰Ûªll need a large, wide skillet, pan or pot. Place the onions in the pan, drizzle with 1/4 cup of the olive oil and set over medium-high heat. Stir well and season with a couple pinches of salt. They‰Ûªll cook down. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions start to color and begin to caramelize. I like to let them get super jammy, with lots of color, but not-at all burned. This can take about a half hour. Once you‰Ûªre nearly done cooking the onions, reduce the heat to low and stir in the garlic. Cook until soft, 5-6 minutes. You should end up with 2 or 2 1/2 cups of cooked onions. Set aside."

panade,"Choose an oven-proof 3-quart dutch oven or cast-iron pan or pot (12-cup capacity). See photos. Also note, you‰Ûªre going to want a baking dish that can go from stove-top to oven. Assemble the panade in layers. Start with a layer of onions, followed by a loose layer of bread cubes, another layer of onions, and then a layer of grated cheese. Repeat: bread, onions, cheese, until you‰Ûªve reached the top of your pan. Aim for 2-3 layers of each component, packing down with a bit of pressure if needed. The top layer should have a some of everything. Add a finishing sprinkle of the remaining scallions and the chives. Drizzle with remaining 2 T. olive oil."
panade,"Bring the remaining 4 1/2 cups of broth to a simmer and taste for seasoning, it should taste good enough to drink. Pour it slowly over the panade, in doses, around the edges until it comes up nearly to the rim. Let it sit for a minute, allowing the bread to absorb the broth and add a bit more if needed."
panade,"Set the panade over low heat and bring to a simmer. Look for bubbling at the edges and listen to know. Remove from heat. Cover with a layer of parchment paper, then loosely wrap the top and sides of the pan with foil, careful because the pan can be hot. Place another piece of foil or sheet pan on the rack below your panade in case it bubbles over. Bake for about an hour, before having a peek. Baking time will actually depend on your pan and oven - it can take longer. Take a peek, at this point the top should be getting a bit golden around the edges. If you‰Ûªre not seeing any color, bake longer."
panade,"Uncover the panade, dial your oven to 375F, and bake until beautiful and golden on top, another 15-25 minutes. I sometimes give it a finishing kiss with the broiler if I‰Ûªm not getting enough browning for my taste."
panade,"If you‰Ûªre not ready to serve, re-cover the panade, reduce the oven back to 250F, and you can hold it there for a half an hour or so without issue. You can always test the panade. Basically you want to avoid dryness. Your panade should be silky and unctuous. If it seems a bit on the dry side you can add more hot broth a few tablespoons at a time and serve when ready."

best-lasagna,"Thin out your pasta using a pasta machine. Start by cutting the big sheets into 2-inch(ish) wide ribbons. This usually means making 2 cuts along the sheets. This should yield you about 12 2-foot strips. Run them through the pasta machine. I go to the 7 setting, two shy of the very thinnest setting. The sheets should almost be translucent. Cut the strips into manageable rectangles roughly 4-inches in length."
best-lasagna,"To pre-cook the pasta, fill a large bowl with ice cold water and a few glugs of olive oil. Place a large flour sack or cotton dish towel across one of your counters. Salt your pot of boiling water generously. Ok, now you are ready to boil off your pasta. Believe it or not, you are on the home stretch. Place a handful of the pasta rectangles into the boiling water to cook (I've found I can get away with about 20 at a time), fish them out (I use a spider) after just 15-20 seconds, don't over cook. Transfer them immediately to the cold olive-oil water for a quick swim and cool-off. Remove from the cold water bath and place flat and neat on the cotton towel. It is ok for them to overlap, I don't have a problem with the sheets sticking typically. Repeat until all your pasta is boiled."

Use your hands to bring the dough together into a ball and knead for 7-10 minutes, until the dough is silky smooth and elastic. Keep in mind, some flours are thirstier than others. You can add a bit more water as you go if you feel like your dough is too dry. Or dust with more flour if it is too wet.  I‰Ûªve found that a spray bottle is my favorite way to add water to pasta dough without adding too much."

braided-onion-bread,Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
braided-onion-bread,"Start by making the filling. You can do this a day or two ahead of time, and refrigerate. Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat, and stir in the onions along with a generous pinch of salt. Saute, stirring regularly, until the onions get brown and caramelized - twenty minutes or so. Remove from heat, allow to cool, and then stir in the cheese and 1/4 cup of the sesame seeds. Set aside or refrigerate until ready to use. If you‰Ûªve cooked your filling ahead of time and refrigerated it, bring it back to room temperature before filling your dough."
braided-onion-bread,"To make the dough, combine 2 cups of the flour, the sugar, salt, and yeast in a medium bowl. Add the warm milk and stir just until you don‰Ûªt see any more dry flour. Add the egg and butter, and stir until it is all incorporated. Add the rest of the flour (the remaining 2 1/2 cups) and stir until you have a nice, soft dough."
braided-onion-bread,"Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until a cohesive, not-too-sticky dough forms. Dust with more flour, a tablespoon at a time, if your dough is too wet or tacky. Sometimes I need up to 1/4 cup more flour at this point. Knead for five minutes or so. I like to hold my bench scraper in one hand at this stage, to scrape the dough from the counter when it sticks. When you‰Ûªre done kneading, transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, and cover with a clean towel or plastic wrap. Place in a cozy or sunny spot. Allow to rise and double in size - usually between an hour or two."
braided-onion-bread,"Use your hand and gently press to deflate the dough. Turn out onto a floured surface, and roll the dough out into a rectangle roughly 12-inches wide and 16-inches long. Cut the dough lengthwise into strips 3-inches wide with a pizza cutter or knife. You‰Ûªll have four strips. Divide the filling into four equal portions (roughly 1/2 cup each), and spread a portion of it down just the center of each of the four strips, leaving the edges clear. Fold each strip in half and pinch to seal the filling in all the way down the length of each strip. At this point you should have 4 ‰ÛÏtubes‰Û of filled dough, and it‰Ûªs time to braid!"
braided-onion-bread,"Quickly and assertively transfer the strips to your parchment lined baking sheet a couple inches apart. Ideally, they‰Ûªll be seam side down. Now, this part can get a bit crazy, don‰Ûªt get flustered. If the strips stretch out, don‰Ûªt panic. If they‰Ûªre longer than the pan, don‰Ûªt sweat it. Just keep going. You‰Ûªre going to braid and coil the dough, so most of the mistakes you make don‰Ûªt really matter! Pinch the four strands together at the top, and start to braid."
braided-onion-bread,"Take a look at my sketch up above for more clarification, if needed. Take the left strand and move it over two strands (to the right) and under one strand back to the left. Switch to the other side: take the most right strand and lift it over two strands to the left and back under one strand to the right. Repeat, alternating from left side to right side until the loaf is complete. I find it easiest to say out loud, ‰ÛÏover two under one, over two under one.‰Û Pinch the ends together. Now, use your hands to coax the braid into a coil, like a snail shell. The fuller, top of the braid should be the center, and then keep wrapping around until you reach the end. Tuck the end under. It should be fairly snug. Cover loosely and allow to double in a cozy spot - usually 30 minutes to an hour. While you‰Ûªre waiting, preheat your oven to 350F with a rack in the center."
braided-onion-bread,"Last step is to glaze your bread! Whisk the egg yolk with 2 tablespoons of water. Brush the dough completely with the glaze and sprinkle with the remaining sesame seeds. Bake until the bread is beautifully golden, and cooked through, roughly 35-40 minutes. To be extra sure, I use a thermometer to make sure the dough in the center reaches about 190F, and then you know you‰Ûªre a-ok. Transfer to a baking rack to cool. Enjoy!"

steaming-vegetables,"Bottom tray: equal-sized chunks of slower-cooking vegetables. For example: sweet potato, potato, winter squash, beets. These usually cook through in about ten minutes. Middle-tray: equal sized pieces of broccoli, cauliflower.åÊTop-tray/last minute: asparagus, fava beans (inner pods), snap peas."
steaming-vegetables,"Bring an inch of water to a simmer in a skillet large enough to accommodate the diameter of your steamer. Alternately, you can use a wok. The water should not be so high that it makes contact with the vegetables when the steamer is placed in the skillet - do a quick test if you're unsure, and remove some water if needed."
steaming-vegetables,"The goal here is to have your vegetables perfectly cooked and ready to serve just before you sit down. And, ideally, all of the vegetables finish cooking at the same time. Here's how you do it. Roughly ten minutes before you're ready to serve, place the slow-cooking, bottom tray vegetables over the simmering water, covered. Let them steam there until they're about 2/3 cooked, about 6-7 minutes. Test, and cut into any root vegetables toward the end to make sure they're going to be cooked through."
steaming-vegetables,"The mid tray only needs 3-4 minutes, so add that next, moving the lid up a level. And the top tray vegetables, like snap peas and asparagus, just need a kiss of steam to brighten, barely a minute. Add that last. Or if you only have two baskets, add these to the broccoli/cauliflower basket to finish. You'll have to make slight adjustments based on the sizes of your vegetables, but this is the general idea. Cook them until they're bright, just tender, and taste good to you."

Just 30 seconds or so. Stir in the tomatoes, the juices from the cans, and 6 cups / 1.5 L of water. Simmer for fifteen minutes or so, then puree with a hand blender until smooth. This is the version you see up above (minus the toppings). That said, at this point you can decide if you'd like your soup even a bit thinner - if so, you can thin it with more water, or if you like a creamy version, with some coconut milk. Taste and adjust with more salt to taste."
simple-tomato-soup-recipe,"This soup is great served simply with a dollop of cream from the top of a can of coconut milk (a little goes a long way) and a toasted wedge of good bread. That said, I love it most with the coconut cream, served over a scoop of brown rice with a squeeze of lemon, some toasted almonds, and a jolt of herbs (fresh, or the sort of oregano drizzle I used here)."

panade,Cut or tear sourdough into rough 1-inch cubes. Set aside.
panade,"You can prepare these a day or two in advance if you like. You‰Ûªll need a large, wide skillet, pan or pot. Place the onions in the pan, drizzle with 1/4 cup of the olive oil and set over medium-high heat. Stir well and season with a couple pinches of salt. They‰Ûªll cook down. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions start to color and begin to caramelize. I like to let them get super jammy, with lots of color, but not-at all burned. This can take about a half hour. Once you‰Ûªre nearly done cooking the onions, reduce the heat to low and stir in the garlic. Cook until soft, 5-6 minutes. You should end up with 2 or 2 1/2 cups of cooked onions. Set aside."
panade,Preheat the oven to 325F.
panade,Place the bread cubes in a large bowl drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 1/2 cup of the broth. Add 1 cup of the scallions and a few pinches of salt. Use your hands to toss and gently squeeze the bread cubes until evenly moist. Set aside.
panade,"Choose an oven-proof 3-quart dutch oven or cast-iron pan or pot (12-cup capacity). See photos. Also note, you‰Ûªre going to want a baking dish that can go from stove-top to oven. Assemble the panade in layers. Start with a layer of onions, followed by a loose layer of bread cubes, another layer of onions, and then a layer of grated cheese. Repeat: bread, onions, cheese, until you‰Ûªve reached the top of your pan. Aim for 2-3 layers of each component, packing down with a bit of pressure if needed. The top layer should have a some of everything. Add a finishing sprinkle of the remaining scallions and the chives. Drizzle with remaining 2 T. olive oil."
panade,"Bring the remaining 4 1/2 cups of broth to a simmer and taste for seasoning, it should taste good enough to drink. Pour it slowly over the panade, in doses, around the edges until it comes up nearly to the rim. Let it sit for a minute, allowing the bread to absorb the broth and add a bit more if needed."
panade,"Set the panade over low heat and bring to a simmer. Look for bubbling at the edges and listen to know. Remove from heat. Cover with a layer of parchment paper, then loosely wrap the top and sides of the pan with foil, careful because the pan can be hot. Place another piece of foil or sheet pan on the rack below your panade in case it bubbles over. Bake for about an hour, before having a peek. Baking time will actually depend on your pan and oven - it can take longer. Take a peek, at this point the top should be getting a bit golden around the edges. If you‰Ûªre not seeing any color, bake longer."
panade,"Uncover the panade, dial your oven to 375F, and bake until beautiful and golden on top, another 15-25 minutes. I sometimes give it a finishing kiss with the broiler if I‰Ûªm not getting enough browning for my taste."
panade,"If you‰Ûªre not ready to serve, re-cover the panade, reduce the oven back to 250F, and you can hold it there for a half an hour or so without issue. You can always test the panade. Basically you want to avoid dryness. Your panade should be silky and unctuous. If it seems a bit on the dry side you can add more hot broth a few tablespoons at a time and serve when ready."
panade,Serve in pan after allowing to sit outside the oven for 10 minutes.

best-lasagna,"Thin out your pasta using a pasta machine. Start by cutting the big sheets into 2-inch(ish) wide ribbons. This usually means making 2 cuts along the sheets. This should yield you about 12 2-foot strips. Run them through the pasta machine. I go to the 7 setting, two shy of the very thinnest setting. The sheets should almost be translucent. Cut the strips into manageable rectangles roughly 4-inches in length."
best-lasagna,"To pre-cook the pasta, fill a large bowl with ice cold water and a few glugs of olive oil. Place a large flour sack or cotton dish towel across one of your counters. Salt your pot of boiling water generously. Ok, now you are ready to boil off your pasta. Believe it or not, you are on the home stretch. Place a handful of the pasta rectangles into the boiling water to cook (I've found I can get away with about 20 at a time), fish them out (I use a spider) after just 15-20 seconds, don't over cook. Transfer them immediately to the cold olive-oil water for a quick swim and cool-off. Remove from the cold water bath and place flat and neat on the cotton towel. It is ok for them to overlap, I don't have a problem with the sheets sticking typically. Repeat until all your pasta is boiled."
best-lasagna,"Ladle a bit of the sauce into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Cover the bottom with a layer of pasta sheets. Now a thin layer of sauce, and a bit of cheese. Go for another layer of pasta, then sauce, then pasta again, then sauce and cheese. Keep going until you've used up all the sauce and pasta. You want to finish with a layer of pasta. Top with the last of the sauce and the very last of the cheese so you have a nice cheesy top."

braided-onion-bread,Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
braided-onion-bread,"Start by making the filling. You can do this a day or two ahead of time, and refrigerate. Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat, and stir in the onions along with a generous pinch of salt. Saute, stirring regularly, until the onions get brown and caramelized - twenty minutes or so. Remove from heat, allow to cool, and then stir in the cheese and 1/4 cup of the sesame seeds. Set aside or refrigerate until ready to use. If you‰Ûªve cooked your filling ahead of time and refrigerated it, bring it back to room temperature before filling your dough."
braided-onion-bread,"To make the dough, combine 2 cups of the flour, the sugar, salt, and yeast in a medium bowl. Add the warm milk and stir just until you don‰Ûªt see any more dry flour. Add the egg and butter, and stir until it is all incorporated. Add the rest of the flour (the remaining 2 1/2 cups) and stir until you have a nice, soft dough."
braided-onion-bread,"Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until a cohesive, not-too-sticky dough forms. Dust with more flour, a tablespoon at a time, if your dough is too wet or tacky. Sometimes I need up to 1/4 cup more flour at this point. Knead for five minutes or so. I like to hold my bench scraper in one hand at this stage, to scrape the dough from the counter when it sticks. When you‰Ûªre done kneading, transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, and cover with a clean towel or plastic wrap. Place in a cozy or sunny spot. Allow to rise and double in size - usually between an hour or two."
braided-onion-bread,"Use your hand and gently press to deflate the dough. Turn out onto a floured surface, and roll the dough out into a rectangle roughly 12-inches wide and 16-inches long. Cut the dough lengthwise into strips 3-inches wide with a pizza cutter or knife. You‰Ûªll have four strips. Divide the filling into four equal portions (roughly 1/2 cup each), and spread a portion of it down just the center of each of the four strips, leaving the edges clear. Fold each strip in half and pinch to seal the filling in all the way down the length of each strip. At this point you should have 4 ‰ÛÏtubes‰Û of filled dough, and it‰Ûªs time to braid!"
braided-onion-bread,"Quickly and assertively transfer the strips to your parchment lined baking sheet a couple inches apart. Ideally, they‰Ûªll be seam side down. Now, this part can get a bit crazy, don‰Ûªt get flustered. If the strips stretch out, don‰Ûªt panic. If they‰Ûªre longer than the pan, don‰Ûªt sweat it. Just keep going. You‰Ûªre going to braid and coil the dough, so most of the mistakes you make don‰Ûªt really matter! Pinch the four strands together at the top, and start to braid."
braided-onion-bread,"Take a look at my sketch up above for more clarification, if needed. Take the left strand and move it over two strands (to the right) and under one strand back to the left. Switch to the other side: take the most right strand and lift it over two strands to the left and back under one strand to the right. Repeat, alternating from left side to right side until the loaf is complete. I find it easiest to say out loud, ‰ÛÏover two under one, over two under one.‰Û Pinch the ends together. Now, use your hands to coax the braid into a coil, like a snail shell. The fuller, top of the braid should be the center, and then keep wrapping around until you reach the end. Tuck the end under. It should be fairly snug. Cover loosely and allow to double in a cozy spot - usually 30 minutes to an hour. While you‰Ûªre waiting, preheat your oven to 350F with a rack in the center."
braided-onion-bread,"Last step is to glaze your bread! Whisk the egg yolk with 2 tablespoons of water. Brush the dough completely with the glaze and sprinkle with the remaining sesame seeds. Bake until the bread is beautifully golden, and cooked through, roughly 35-40 minutes. To be extra sure, I use a thermometer to make sure the dough in the center reaches about 190F, and then you know you‰Ûªre a-ok. Transfer to a baking rack to cool. Enjoy!"

Use your extra fingers to keep ingredients in place and to pull the roll in toward the sushi mat. The goal is shaping and keeping things tight. Keep guiding and rolling. Once the rice and fillings have been encircled by the nori, compress and pull things tight one more time. I basically run my hands along the length of the roll making sure nothing is loose."

steaming-vegetables,"Wash your vegetables well, and cut them into bite-sized pieces. I tend to leave peels on, but it is a personal preference. Arrange them, in a single layer, in steamer trays according to needed cooking time. For example:"
steaming-vegetables,"Bottom tray: equal-sized chunks of slower-cooking vegetables. For example: sweet potato, potato, winter squash, beets. These usually cook through in about ten minutes. Middle-tray: equal sized pieces of broccoli, cauliflower.åÊTop-tray/last minute: asparagus, fava beans (inner pods), snap peas."
steaming-vegetables,"Bring an inch of water to a simmer in a skillet large enough to accommodate the diameter of your steamer. Alternately, you can use a wok. The water should not be so high that it makes contact with the vegetables when the steamer is placed in the skillet - do a quick test if you're unsure, and remove some water if needed."
steaming-vegetables,"The goal here is to have your vegetables perfectly cooked and ready to serve just before you sit down. And, ideally, all of the vegetables finish cooking at the same time. Here's how you do it. Roughly ten minutes before you're ready to serve, place the slow-cooking, bottom tray vegetables over the simmering water, covered. Let them steam there until they're about 2/3 cooked, about 6-7 minutes. Test, and cut into any root vegetables toward the end to make sure they're going to be cooked through."
steaming-vegetables,"The mid tray only needs 3-4 minutes, so add that next, moving the lid up a level. And the top tray vegetables, like snap peas and asparagus, just need a kiss of steam to brighten, barely a minute. Add that last. Or if you only have two baskets, add these to the broccoli/cauliflower basket to finish. You'll have to make slight adjustments based on the sizes of your vegetables, but this is the general idea. Cook them until they're bright, just tender, and taste good to you."

Be sure you get all the avocado near the skin, it's the best part. Sprinkle the avocado with the onions and garlic, and use a large fork to fold everything together. I like a chunky guacamole, so I tend to fold, chop with the edge of the fork, fold, chop. After a few folds add the lime juice, and fold some more. Taste and adjust with more salt or lime juice, and serve topped with cilantro and chives (or chive blossoms)."
guacamole,"You can store any uneaten guacamole in a refrigerator. Any surface area exposed to air will likely brown, so (preferably) use a glass jar (Weck) where the lid comes in contact with the avocado, or a piece of plastic wrap pressed to suface."

how-to-cook-artichokes,"Fill a bowl with water, squeeze the juice of the lemon into it. You'll add the artichokes to the water immediately after trimming."
how-to-cook-artichokes,"To trim your artichokes: Actually, before I get into the details of trimming, let's just establish what we're after. We're after the tender. Meaning, we want to trim any tough outer leaves, tips, and stem. We want to get down to the tender parts of the leaves, without trimming so much that we have little left. To start, trim the stem. Pull the outer leaves from the artichoke, until you get down to the more tender leaves. Cut off the top of the artichoke (roughly where it begins to taper in), you want to remove the tough part of the tips. I like to use a serrated knife for that cut. From here decide what shape you'd like your artichoke pieces to be. For this preparation, I cut each artichoke in halves, and/or quarters. If you are using larger artichokes, ones that have developed a fuzzy choke, you'll need to use a teaspoon (or mellon baller) to carve the fuzz out before moving on to your final cuts. Work efficiently, and get the trimmed artichokes in the lemon water as quickly as possible to reduce browning from oxidation."
how-to-cook-artichokes,"While prepping the artichokes, bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Salt well, and use a slotted spoon to transfer them from the lemon water to the boiling water. Boil until just tender, typically a minute or two. Drain well, and set aside. Alternately, you can steam the artichokes - this will keep more of the nutrients intact. Either way, you want the artichokes to be cooked tender (and feel free to eat them at this point)!"
how-to-cook-artichokes,"I can't resist a bit of crust and crunch to them, so... Heat a tablespoon of oil or clarified butter in a large saucepan over medium high heat. When hot, transfer the artichokes to the pan in a single layer. Toss to coat, and add a pinch or two of salt. Allow to saute, tossing every few minutes, until the artichokes are deeply golden and crusted."

Place the onions in the pan, drizzle with 1/4 cup of the olive oil and set over medium-high heat. Stir well and season with a couple pinches of salt. Theyâ€™ll cook down. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions start to color and begin to caramelize. I like to let them get super jammy, with lots of color, but not-at all burned. This can take about a half hour. Once youâ€™re nearly done cooking the onions, reduce the heat to low and stir in the garlic. Cook until soft, 5-6 minutes. You should end up with 2 or 2 1/2 cups of cooked onions. Set aside."

Assemble the panade in layers. Start with a layer of onions, followed by a loose layer of bread cubes, another layer of onions, and then a layer of grated cheese. Repeat: bread, onions, cheese, until youâ€™ve reached the top of your pan. Aim for 2-3 layers of each component, packing down with a bit of pressure if needed. The top layer should have a some of everything. Add a finishing sprinkle of the remaining scallions and the chives. Drizzle with remaining 2 T. olive oil."
panade,"Bring the remaining 4 1/2 cups of broth to a simmer and taste for seasoning, it should taste good enough to drink. Pour it slowly over the panade, in doses, around the edges until it comes up nearly to the rim. Let it sit for a minute, allowing the bread to absorb the broth and add a bit more if needed."
panade,"Set the panade over low heat and bring to a simmer. Look for bubbling at the edges and listen to know. Remove from heat. Cover with a layer of parchment paper, then loosely wrap the top and sides of the pan with foil, careful because the pan can be hot. Place another piece of foil or sheet pan on the rack below your panade in case it bubbles over. Bake for about an hour, before having a peek. Baking time will actually depend on your pan and oven - it can take longer. Take a peek, at this point the top should be getting a bit golden around the edges. If youâ€™re not seeing any color, bake longer."
panade,"Uncover the panade, dial your oven to 375F, and bake until beautiful and golden on top, another 15-25 minutes. I sometimes give it a finishing kiss with the broiler if Iâ€™m not getting enough browning for my taste."
panade,"If youâ€™re not ready to serve, re-cover the panade, reduce the oven back to 250F, and you can hold it there for a half an hour or so without issue. You can always test the panade. Basically you want to avoid dryness. Your panade should be silky and unctuous. If it seems a bit on the dry side you can add more hot broth a few tablespoons at a time and serve when ready."

pesto-recipe,"Start chopping the garlic along with about 1/3 of the basil leaves. Once this is loosely chopped add more basil, chop some more, add the rest of the basil, chop some more. I scrape and chop, gather and chop. At this point the basil and garlic should be a very fine mince. Add about half the pine nuts, chop. Add the rest of the pine nuts, chop. Add half of the Parmesan, chop. Add the rest of the Parmesan, and chop. In the end you want a chop so fine that you can press all the ingredients into a basil ""cake"" - see the photo up above.  Transfer the pesto ""cake"" to a small bowl (not much bigger than the cake)."
pesto-recipe,"Cover the pesto ""cake"" with a bit of olive oil. It doesn't take much, just a few tablespoons. At this point, you can set the pesto aside, or place it in the refrigerator until you are ready to use it. Just before serving, give the pesto a quick stir to incorporate some of the oil into the basil. Francesca's mom occasionally thins the pesto with a splash of pasta water for more coverage, but for our gnocchi this wasn't necessary."

braided-onion-bread,Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
braided-onion-bread,"Start by making the filling. You can do this a day or two ahead of time, and refrigerate. Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat, and stir in the onions along with a generous pinch of salt. Saute, stirring regularly, until the onions get brown and caramelized - twenty minutes or so. Remove from heat, allow to cool, and then stir in the cheese and 1/4 cup of the sesame seeds. Set aside or refrigerate until ready to use. If youâ€™ve cooked your filling ahead of time and refrigerated it, bring it back to room temperature before filling your dough."
braided-onion-bread,"To make the dough, combine 2 cups of the flour, the sugar, salt, and yeast in a medium bowl. Add the warm milk and stir just until you donâ€™t see any more dry flour. Add the egg and butter, and stir until it is all incorporated. Add the rest of the flour (the remaining 2 1/2 cups) and stir until you have a nice, soft dough."
braided-onion-bread,"Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until a cohesive, not-too-sticky dough forms. Dust with more flour, a tablespoon at a time, if your dough is too wet or tacky. Sometimes I need up to 1/4 cup more flour at this point. Knead for five minutes or so. I like to hold my bench scraper in one hand at this stage, to scrape the dough from the counter when it sticks. When youâ€™re done kneading, transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, and cover with a clean towel or plastic wrap. Place in a cozy or sunny spot. Allow to rise and double in size - usually between an hour or two."
braided-onion-bread,"Use your hand and gently press to deflate the dough. Turn out onto a floured surface, and roll the dough out into a rectangle roughly 12-inches wide and 16-inches long. Cut the dough lengthwise into strips 3-inches wide with a pizza cutter or knife. Youâ€™ll have four strips. Divide the filling into four equal portions (roughly 1/2 cup each), and spread a portion of it down just the center of each of the four strips, leaving the edges clear. Fold each strip in half and pinch to seal the filling in all the way down the length of each strip. At this point you should have 4 â€œtubesâ€ of filled dough, and itâ€™s time to braid!"
braided-onion-bread,"Quickly and assertively transfer the strips to your parchment lined baking sheet a couple inches apart. Ideally, theyâ€™ll be seam side down. Now, this part can get a bit crazy, donâ€™t get flustered. If the strips stretch out, donâ€™t panic. If theyâ€™re longer than the pan, donâ€™t sweat it. Just keep going. Youâ€™re going to braid and coil the dough, so most of the mistakes you make donâ€™t really matter! Pinch the four strands together at the top, and start to braid."
braided-onion-bread,"Take a look at my sketch up above for more clarification, if needed. Take the left strand and move it over two strands (to the right) and under one strand back to the left. Switch to the other side: take the most right strand and lift it over two strands to the left and back under one strand to the right. Repeat, alternating from left side to right side until the loaf is complete. I find it easiest to say out loud, â€œover two under one, over two under one.â€ Pinch the ends together. Now, use your hands to coax the braid into a coil, like a snail shell. The fuller, top of the braid should be the center, and then keep wrapping around until you reach the end. Tuck the end under. It should be fairly snug. Cover loosely and allow to double in a cozy spot - usually 30 minutes to an hour. While youâ€™re waiting, preheat your oven to 350F with a rack in the center."
braided-onion-bread,"Last step is to glaze your bread! Whisk the egg yolk with 2 tablespoons of water. Brush the dough completely with the glaze and sprinkle with the remaining sesame seeds. Bake until the bread is beautifully golden, and cooked through, roughly 35-40 minutes. To be extra sure, I use a thermometer to make sure the dough in the center reaches about 190F, and then you know youâ€™re a-ok. Transfer to a baking rack to cool. Enjoy!"

steaming-vegetables,"Wash your vegetables well, and cut them into bite-sized pieces. I tend to leave peels on, but it is a personal preference. Arrange them, in a single layer, in steamer trays according to needed cooking time. For example:"
steaming-vegetables,"Bottom tray: equal-sized chunks of slower-cooking vegetables. For example: sweet potato, potato, winter squash, beets. These usually cook through in about ten minutes. Middle-tray: equal sized pieces of broccoli, cauliflower.Â Top-tray/last minute: asparagus, fava beans (inner pods), snap peas."
steaming-vegetables,"Bring an inch of water to a simmer in a skillet large enough to accommodate the diameter of your steamer. Alternately, you can use a wok. The water should not be so high that it makes contact with the vegetables when the steamer is placed in the skillet - do a quick test if you're unsure, and remove some water if needed."
steaming-vegetables,"The goal here is to have your vegetables perfectly cooked and ready to serve just before you sit down. And, ideally, all of the vegetables finish cooking at the same time. Here's how you do it. Roughly ten minutes before you're ready to serve, place the slow-cooking, bottom tray vegetables over the simmering water, covered. Let them steam there until they're about 2/3 cooked, about 6-7 minutes. Test, and cut into any root vegetables toward the end to make sure they're going to be cooked through."
steaming-vegetables,"The mid tray only needs 3-4 minutes, so add that next, moving the lid up a level. And the top tray vegetables, like snap peas and asparagus, just need a kiss of steam to brighten, barely a minute. Add that last. Or if you only have two baskets, add these to the broccoli/cauliflower basket to finish. You'll have to make slight adjustments based on the sizes of your vegetables, but this is the general idea. Cook them until they're bright, just tender, and taste good to you."
steaming-vegetables,"I like to quickly arrange the steamed vegetables, nested, in one basket to serve along with a drizzle of good oil - toasted sesame, shallot, olive oil, herb, etc. With a sprinkle of flaky sea salt."

Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then mix on medium speed for 30 more seconds.Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then add the flour mixture. Mix on low speed just until uniform in texture. Using a rubber spatula, scrape the dough out into an airtight container or onto a piece of plastic wrap. Cover the container, or, if using plastic wrap, shape the dough into a rough disk, wrap tightly, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours and up to 5 days."
snickerdoodle-cookies,"Preheat the oven to 350Â°F (175Â°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Roll 1/4-cup (60 ml) portions of the dough into balls, and place them on the baking sheet, spacing them at least 2 inches (5 cm) apart. Bake for about 16 minutes, until golden but not too dark, rotating the pan midway through the baking time. Ideally, the baked cookies will be tall and slightly undercooked in the center, and will buckle shortly after coming out of the oven. If the cookies don't buckle, don't worry; they'll still be delicious. Let the cookies cool on the pan for 10 minutes before removing. These cookies are best when eaten warm, shortly after they come out of the oven. However, they can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. Alternatively, the dough can stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, so consider baking only as many cookies as needed and saving the rest of the dough to bake another day."

quick-pickled-zucchini,"Toss the zucchini, onion, shallots, and salt together in a colander and place over a bowl to catch the liquids. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least a couple hours. Toss once or twice along the way. You're aiming to get as much liquid out of the zucchini as possible.â€¨â€¨When you're finished draining the zucchini, shake off any water. At this point you want the zucchini as dry as possible. Place in a 1 liter / 1 quart jar along with the dill, chile pepper, and mustard seeds. Alternately, you can cram them into a 3/4 liter Weck jar like I do, but it's always a bit snug in the jar."

celery-salt,"Pick the leaves from each celery stalk, leaving the stems behind. The outer leaves tend to be dark green and hearty, the inner leaves pale green and tender. I use them all."
celery-salt,"Rinse the leaves with cold water in a strainer, then shake off as much of the water as you can. At this point you want to dry the leaves as much as possible, so they toast (not steam) when you cook them. Gently pat them dry in a clean dish towel, or paper towels. Once dry you have two options for toasting the leaves."

best-pizza-dough-ever,"Stir together the flour, salt, and instant yeast in a 4-quart bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). With a large metal spoon, stir in the oil and the cold water until the flour is all absorbed (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment), If you are mixing by hand, repeatedly dip one of your hands or the metal spoon into cold water and use it, much like a dough hook, to work the dough vigorously into a smooth mass while rotating the bowl in a circular motion with the other hand. Reverse the circular motion a few times to develop the gluten further. Do this for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and the ingredients are evenly distributed. If you are using an electric mixer, switch to the dough hook and mix on medium speed for 5 to 7 minutes, or as long as it takes to create a smooth, sticky dough. The dough should clear the sides of the bowl but stick to the bottom of the bowl. If the dough is too wet and doesn't come off the sides of the bowl, sprinkle in some more flour just until it clears the sides. If it clears the bottom of the bowl, dribble in a teaspoon or two of cold water. The finished dough will be springy, elastic, and sticky, not just tacky, and register 50 to 55F."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"Sprinkle flour on the counter and transfer the dough to the counter. Prepare a sheet pan by lining it with baking parchment and misting the parchment with spray oil (or lightly oil the parchment). Using a metal dough scraper, cut the dough into 6 equal pieces (or larger if you are comfortable shaping large pizzas), You can dip the scraper into the water between cuts to keep the dough from sticking to it, Sprinkle flour over the dough. Make sure your hands are dry and then flour them. Lift each piece and gently round it into a ball. If the dough sticks to your hands, dip your hands into the flour again. Transfer the dough balls to the sheet pan, Mist the dough generously with spray oil and slip the pan into a food-grade plastic bag."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"Put the pan into the refrigerator overnight to rest the dough, or keep for up to 3 days. (Note: If you want to save some of the dough for future baking, you can store the dough balls in a zippered freezer bag. Dip each dough ball into a bowl that has a few tablespoons of oil in it, rolling the dough in the oil, and then put each ball into a separate bag. You can place the bags into the freezer for up to 3 months. Transfer them to the refrigerator the day before you plan to make pizza.)"
best-pizza-dough-ever,"On the day you plan to make the pizza, remove the desired number of dough balls from the refrigerator 2 hours before making the pizza. Before letting the dough rest at room temperature for 2 hours, dust the counter with flour, and then mist the counter with spray oil. Place the dough balls on top of the floured counter and sprinkle them with flour; dust your hands with flour. Gently press the dough into flat disks about 1/2 inch thick and 5 inches in diameter. Sprinkle the dough with flour, mist it again with spray oil, and cover the dough loosely with plastic wrap or a food-grade plastic bag. Now let rest for 2 hours."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"At least 45 minutes before making the pizza, place a baking stone either on the floor of the oven (for gas ovens), or on a rack in the lower third of the oven. Heat the oven as hot as possible, up to 800F (most home ovens will go only to 500 to 550F, but some will go higher). If you do not have a baking stone, you can use the back of a sheet pan, but do not preheat the pan."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"Generously dust a peel or the back of a sheet pan with semolina flour or cornmeal. Make the pizzas one at a time. Dip your hands, including the backs of your hands and knuckles, in flour and lift I piece of dough by getting under it with a pastry scraper. Very gently lay the dough across your fists and carefully stretch it by bouncing the dough in a circular motion on your hands, carefully giving it a little stretch with each bounce. If it begins to stick to your hands, lay it down on the floured counter and reflour your hands, then continue shaping it. If you have trouble tossing the dough, or if the dough keeps springing back, let it rest for 5 to 20 minutes so the gluten can relax, and try again. You can also resort to using a rolling pin, though this isn't as effective."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"When the dough is stretched out to your satisfaction (about 9 to 12 inches in diameter for a 6-ounce piece of dough), lay it on the peel or pan, making sure there is enough semolina flour or cornmeal to allow it to slide. Lightly top it with sauce and then with your other toppings, remembering that the best pizzas are topped with a less-is-more philosophy. The American ""kitchen sink"" approach is counterproductive, as it makes the crust more difficult to bake. A few, usually no more than 3 or 4 toppings, including sauce and cheese is sufficient."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"Slide the topped pizza onto the stone (or bake directly on the sheet pan) and close the door. Wait 2 minutes, then take a peek. If it needs to be rotated 180 degrees for even baking, do so. The pizza should take about 5 to 8 minutes to bake. If the top gets done before the bottom, you will need to move the stone to a lower self before the next round. if the bottom crisps before the cheese caramelizes, then you will need to raise the stone for subsequent bakes."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"Remove the pizza from the oven and transfer to a cutting board. Wait 3 to 5 minutes before slicing and serving, to allow the cheese to set slightly."

This can take anywhere from an hour to two hours (potentially more) depending on your beans, but do your best to avoid overcooking. Remove from heat, salt the beans (still in bean broth) with about a tablespoon of salt - enough that the bean liquid is tasty but on the salty side. Let the beans sit like this for ten minutes or so before draining and setting the beans aside."
chipotle-baked-beans,"In the meantime, place the 2 tablespoons olive oil, red pepper flakes, couple pinches of salt, and chopped garlic into a cold medium saucepan. Stir while you heat the saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute just 45 seconds or so until everything is fragrant - you don't want the garlic to brown. Stir in the tomatoes and the fresh oregano and heat to a gentle simmer, this takes just a couple minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the adobo sauce - carefully take a taste (you don't want to burn your tongue)...If the sauce needs more salt add it now, more chipotle flavor? Go for it. Set aside."

Pulse the onions a few times in a food processor. Add the garbanzos, eggs, and salt. Puree until the mixture is the consistency of a very thick, slightly chunky hummus. Pour into a mixing bowl and stir in the cilantro, zest, and sprouts. Add the breadcrumbs, stir, and let sit for a couple of minutes so the crumbs can absorb some of the moisture. At this point, you should have a moist mixture that you can easily form into twelve 1 1/2-inch-thick patties, or six larger patties. I err on the moist side here, because it makes for a nicely textured burger. You can always add more bread crumbs a bit at a time to firm up the dough if need be. Conversely, a bit of water or more egg can be used to moisten the batter."
ultimate-veggie-burger,"Heat the oil in a heavy skillet over medium low, add 4 patties, cover, and cook for 7 to 10 minutes, until the bottoms begin to brown. Turn up the heat if there is no browning after 10 minutes. Flip the patties and cook the second side for 7 minutes, or until golden. Remove from the skillet and cool on a wire rack while you cook the remaining patties. Carefully cut each patty in half, insert your favorite fillings, and enjoy immediately."

Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions start to color and begin to caramelize. I like to let them get super jammy, with lots of color, but not-at all burned. This can take about a half hour. Once youâ€™re nearly done cooking the onions, reduce the heat to low and stir in the garlic. Cook until soft, 5-6 minutes. You should end up with 2 or 2 1/2 cups of cooked onions. Set aside."

Assemble the panade in layers. Start with a layer of onions, followed by a loose layer of bread cubes, another layer of onions, and then a layer of grated cheese. Repeat: bread, onions, cheese, until youâ€™ve reached the top of your pan. Aim for 2-3 layers of each component, packing down with a bit of pressure if needed. The top layer should have a some of everything. Add a finishing sprinkle of the remaining scallions and the chives. Drizzle with remaining 2 T. olive oil."
panade,"Bring the remaining 4 1/2 cups of broth to a simmer and taste for seasoning, it should taste good enough to drink. Pour it slowly over the panade, in doses, around the edges until it comes up nearly to the rim. Let it sit for a minute, allowing the bread to absorb the broth and add a bit more if needed."
panade,"Set the panade over low heat and bring to a simmer. Look for bubbling at the edges and listen to know. Remove from heat. Cover with a layer of parchment paper, then loosely wrap the top and sides of the pan with foil, careful because the pan can be hot. Place another piece of foil or sheet pan on the rack below your panade in case it bubbles over. Bake for about an hour, before having a peek. Baking time will actually depend on your pan and oven - it can take longer. Take a peek, at this point the top should be getting a bit golden around the edges. If youâ€™re not seeing any color, bake longer."
panade,"Uncover the panade, dial your oven to 375F, and bake until beautiful and golden on top, another 15-25 minutes. I sometimes give it a finishing kiss with the broiler if Iâ€™m not getting enough browning for my taste."
panade,"If youâ€™re not ready to serve, re-cover the panade, reduce the oven back to 250F, and you can hold it there for a half an hour or so without issue. You can always test the panade. Basically you want to avoid dryness. Your panade should be silky and unctuous. If it seems a bit on the dry side you can add more hot broth a few tablespoons at a time and serve when ready."

Cut the strips into manageable rectangles roughly 4-inches in length."

Salt your pot of boiling water generously. Ok, now you are ready to boil off your pasta. Believe it or not, you are on the home stretch. Place a handful of the pasta rectangles into the boiling water to cook (I've found I can get away with about 20 at a time), fish them out (I use a spider) after just 15-20 seconds, don't over cook.

gnocchi-recipe,"Remove the potatoes from the water one at a time with a slotted spoon. Place each potato piece on a large cutting board and peel it before moving on to the next potato. Save the potato water. Also, peel each potato as soon as possible after removing from the water (without burning yourself) - I've found a paring knife comes in handy here. Be mindful that you want to work relatively quickly so you can mash the potatoes when they are hot. To do this you can either push the potatoes through a ricer, or do what I do, deconstruct them one at a time on the cutting board using the tines of a fork - mash isn't quite the right term here. I run the fork down the sides of the peeled potato creating a nice, fluffy potato base to work with (see photo). Don't over-mash - you are simply after an even consistency with no noticeable lumps."
gnocchi-recipe,Let the potatoes cool spread out across the cutting board - ten or fifteen minutes. Long enough that the egg won't cook when it is incorporated into the potatoes.
gnocchi-recipe,"When you're ready, pull the potatoes into a soft mound. Drizzle with the beaten egg and sprinkle 3/4 cup of the flour across the top. I've found that a metal spatula or large pastry scraper are both great utensils to use to incorporate the flour and eggs into the potatoes with the egg incorporated throughout - you can see the hint of yellow from the yolk. Scrape underneath and fold, scrape and fold until the mixture is a light crumble. Very gently, with a feathery touch knead the dough. This is also the point you can add more flour (a sprinkle at a time) if the dough is too tacky. I usually end up using most of the remaining 1/4 cup flour, but it all depends on the potatoes, the flour, the time of year, the weather, and whether the gnocchi gods are smiling on you. The dough should be moist but not sticky. It should feel almost billowy.Â "

With confidence and an assertive (but very light) touch, use your thumb and press in and down the length of the fork. The gnocchi should curl into a slight ""C"" shape, their backs will capture the impression of the tines as tiny ridges (good for catching sauce later). Set each gnocchi aside, dust with a bit more flour if needed, until you are ready to boil them. This step takes some practice, don't get discouraged, once you get the hang of it it's easy."

Cook the gnocchi in batches by dropping them into the boiling water roughly twenty at a time. They will let you know when they are cooked because they will pop back up to the top. Fish them out of the water a few at a time with a slotted spoon ten seconds or so after they've surfaced. Have a large platter ready with a generous swirl of whatever sauce or favorite pesto you'll be serving on the gnocchi. Place the gnocchi on the platter. Continue cooking in batches until all the gnocchi are done. Gently toss with more sauce or pesto (don't overdo it, it should be a light dressing), and serve immediately, family-style with a drizzle of good olive oil on top."

homemade-pasta,"Start by making a mound of the flour directly on the countertop. Make a deep crater in the top and add the eggs, olive oil, and salt. Use a fork to break up the eggs without breaking through the walls of your mound. You want to try to keep the eggs contained, but donâ€™t worry if they break through - use a spatula or bench scraper to scoop them back in. Work more and more flour into the eggs a bit at a time. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of cold water across the mixture and keep mixing until youâ€™ve got a dough coming together. If youâ€™re exclusively using all-purpose flour, you might not need more water. Some of the other flours are a bit thirstier, you can drizzle a bit more at time as you go if you feel like your dough is too dry. It should look like the pictures up above, you want to avoid having a wet dough. Iâ€™ve found that a spray bottle is my favorite way to add water to pasta dough without adding too much. Use your hands to bring the dough together into a ball and knead for 7-10 minutes, until the dough is silky smooth and elastic."
homemade-pasta,"Form the dough into a ball and place in a plastic bag, alternately, wrap in plastic wrap. Allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. Use Immediately, or refrigerate for up to a day. You might be able to get away with two days, but the dough will start to discolor."
homemade-pasta,"At this point either roll the pasta out thinly with a rolling pin or use a pasta maker (see notes and photos above). If your dough was refrigerated, bring it to room temperature before rolling out. After cutting the pasta into your desired shape you can cook the pasta immediately, dry it, refrigerate it, or freeze it at this point (see above)."
homemade-pasta,"When youâ€™re ready to cook the pasta do it in a large pot of well-salted water. Depending on the thickness and shape of your pasta, this might just take a minute or so. Reserve a cup or two of the pasta water (in case you want to use it for a sauce), drain the pasta, and use immediately."
homemade-pasta,"Add the flour, eggs, olive oil, salt and 2 tablespoons of water to the bowl of a stand mixer. Use the dough hook to knead on medium speed for 6-7 minutes. Youâ€™ll likely need to add more water, a small splash at a time, just until the dough comes together, you want to avoid an over-wet or sticky dough. See the pictures up above. Mix until the dough looks silky, elastic, and smooth."

homemade-pasta,"Roll out your pasta dough (see above). I typically choose 3 or 4 on the Atlas for fettuccine noodles, or the equivalent on the Kitchen Aid attachment. You'll need a well-floured surface if you're rolling the dough out by hand, and you'll want to keep the pasta nicely floured as well, so it doesn't stick to itself. To cut the dough into fettuccine by hand, loosely fold/roll the dough into a cylinder, and cut with a sharp knife. Alternately, you can run the dough though the fettuccine cutter on your pasta machine."

Cover, and cook turning once, until deeply browned on both sides. Roughly ten minutes. You want to make sure the middle of the patties cook through. If the pan is too hot you'll burn the outsides before the middle cooks up, so be mindful of that."

best-pizza-dough-ever,"Stir together the flour, salt, and instant yeast in a 4-quart bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). With a large metal spoon, stir in the oil and the cold water until the flour is all absorbed (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment), If you are mixing by hand, repeatedly dip one of your hands or the metal spoon into cold water and use it, much like a dough hook, to work the dough vigorously into a smooth mass while rotating the bowl in a circular motion with the other hand. Reverse the circular motion a few times to develop the gluten further. Do this for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and the ingredients are evenly distributed. If you are using an electric mixer, switch to the dough hook and mix on medium speed for 5 to 7 minutes, or as long as it takes to create a smooth, sticky dough. The dough should clear the sides of the bowl but stick to the bottom of the bowl. If the dough is too wet and doesn't come off the sides of the bowl, sprinkle in some more flour just until it clears the sides. If it clears the bottom of the bowl, dribble in a teaspoon or two of cold water. The finished dough will be springy, elastic, and sticky, not just tacky, and register 50 to 55F."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"Sprinkle flour on the counter and transfer the dough to the counter. Prepare a sheet pan by lining it with baking parchment and misting the parchment with spray oil (or lightly oil the parchment). Using a metal dough scraper, cut the dough into 6 equal pieces (or larger if you are comfortable shaping large pizzas), You can dip the scraper into the water between cuts to keep the dough from sticking to it, Sprinkle flour over the dough. Make sure your hands are dry and then flour them. Lift each piece and gently round it into a ball. If the dough sticks to your hands, dip your hands into the flour again. Transfer the dough balls to the sheet pan, Mist the dough generously with spray oil and slip the pan into a food-grade plastic bag."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"Put the pan into the refrigerator overnight to rest the dough, or keep for up to 3 days. (Note: If you want to save some of the dough for future baking, you can store the dough balls in a zippered freezer bag. Dip each dough ball into a bowl that has a few tablespoons of oil in it, rolling the dough in the oil, and then put each ball into a separate bag. You can place the bags into the freezer for up to 3 months. Transfer them to the refrigerator the day before you plan to make pizza.)"
best-pizza-dough-ever,"On the day you plan to make the pizza, remove the desired number of dough balls from the refrigerator 2 hours before making the pizza. Before letting the dough rest at room temperature for 2 hours, dust the counter with flour, and then mist the counter with spray oil. Place the dough balls on top of the floured counter and sprinkle them with flour; dust your hands with flour. Gently press the dough into flat disks about 1/2 inch thick and 5 inches in diameter. Sprinkle the dough with flour, mist it again with spray oil, and cover the dough loosely with plastic wrap or a food-grade plastic bag. Now let rest for 2 hours."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"At least 45 minutes before making the pizza, place a baking stone either on the floor of the oven (for gas ovens), or on a rack in the lower third of the oven. Heat the oven as hot as possible, up to 800F (most home ovens will go only to 500 to 550F, but some will go higher). If you do not have a baking stone, you can use the back of a sheet pan, but do not preheat the pan."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"Generously dust a peel or the back of a sheet pan with semolina flour or cornmeal. Make the pizzas one at a time. Dip your hands, including the backs of your hands and knuckles, in flour and lift I piece of dough by getting under it with a pastry scraper. Very gently lay the dough across your fists and carefully stretch it by bouncing the dough in a circular motion on your hands, carefully giving it a little stretch with each bounce. If it begins to stick to your hands, lay it down on the floured counter and reflour your hands, then continue shaping it. If you have trouble tossing the dough, or if the dough keeps springing back, let it rest for 5 to 20 minutes so the gluten can relax, and try again. You can also resort to using a rolling pin, though this isn't as effective."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"When the dough is stretched out to your satisfaction (about 9 to 12 inches in diameter for a 6-ounce piece of dough), lay it on the peel or pan, making sure there is enough semolina flour or cornmeal to allow it to slide. Lightly top it with sauce and then with your other toppings, remembering that the best pizzas are topped with a less-is-more philosophy. The American ""kitchen sink"" approach is counterproductive, as it makes the crust more difficult to bake. A few, usually no more than 3 or 4 toppings, including sauce and cheese is sufficient."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"Slide the topped pizza onto the stone (or bake directly on the sheet pan) and close the door. Wait 2 minutes, then take a peek. If it needs to be rotated 180 degrees for even baking, do so. The pizza should take about 5 to 8 minutes to bake. If the top gets done before the bottom, you will need to move the stone to a lower self before the next round. if the bottom crisps before the cheese caramelizes, then you will need to raise the stone for subsequent bakes."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"Remove the pizza from the oven and transfer to a cutting board. Wait 3 to 5 minutes before slicing and serving, to allow the cheese to set slightly."

Save the potato water. Also, peel each potato as soon as possible after removing from the water (without burning yourself) - I've found a paring knife comes in handy here. Be mindful that you want to work relatively quickly so you can mash the potatoes when they are hot. To do this you can either push the potatoes through a ricer, or do what I do, deconstruct them one at a time on the cutting board using the tines of a fork - mash isn't quite the right term here. I run the fork down the sides of the peeled potato creating a nice, fluffy potato base to work with (see photo). Don't over-mash - you are simply after an even consistency with no noticeable lumps."

gnocchi-recipe,"When you're ready, pull the potatoes into a soft mound. Drizzle with the beaten egg and sprinkle 3/4 cup of the flour across the top. I've found that a metal spatula or large pastry scraper are both great utensils to use to incorporate the flour and eggs into the potatoes with the egg incorporated throughout - you can see the hint of yellow from the yolk. Scrape underneath and fold, scrape and fold until the mixture is a light crumble. Very gently, with a feathery touch knead the dough. This is also the point you can add more flour (a sprinkle at a time) if the dough is too tacky. I usually end up using most of the remaining 1/4 cup flour, but it all depends on the potatoes, the flour, the time of year, the weather, and whether the gnocchi gods are smiling on you.

The gnocchi should curl into a slight ""C"" shape, their backs will capture the impression of the tines as tiny ridges (good for catching sauce later). Set each gnocchi aside, dust with a bit more flour if needed, until you are ready to boil them. This step takes some practice, don't get discouraged, once you get the hang of it it's easy."
gnocchi-recipe,"Now that you're on the final stretch, either reheat your potato water or start with a fresh pot (salted), and bring to a boil. Cook the gnocchi in batches by dropping them into the boiling water roughly twenty at a time. They will let you know when they are cooked because they will pop back up to the top. Fish them out of the water a few at a time with a slotted spoon ten seconds or so after they've surfaced. Have a large platter ready with a generous swirl of whatever sauce or favorite pesto you'll be serving on the gnocchi. Place the gnocchi on the platter. Continue cooking in batches until all the gnocchi are done. Gently toss with more sauce or pesto (don't overdo it, it should be a light dressing), and serve immediately, family-style with a drizzle of good olive oil on top."

homemade-pasta,"Start by making a mound of the flour directly on the countertop. Make a deep crater in the top and add the eggs, olive oil, and salt. Use a fork to break up the eggs without breaking through the walls of your mound. You want to try to keep the eggs contained, but donâ€™t worry if they break through - use a spatula or bench scraper to scoop them back in. Work more and more flour into the eggs a bit at a time. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of cold water across the mixture and keep mixing until youâ€™ve got a dough coming together. If youâ€™re exclusively using all-purpose flour, you might not need more water. Some of the other flours are a bit thirstier, you can drizzle a bit more at time as you go if you feel like your dough is too dry. It should look like the pictures up above, you want to avoid having a wet dough. Iâ€™ve found that a spray bottle is my favorite way to add water to pasta dough without adding too much. Use your hands to bring the dough together into a ball and knead for 7-10 minutes, until the dough is silky smooth and elastic."
homemade-pasta,"Form the dough into a ball and place in a plastic bag, alternately, wrap in plastic wrap. Allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. Use Immediately, or refrigerate for up to a day. You might be able to get away with two days, but the dough will start to discolor."
homemade-pasta,"At this point either roll the pasta out thinly with a rolling pin or use a pasta maker (see notes and photos above). If your dough was refrigerated, bring it to room temperature before rolling out. After cutting the pasta into your desired shape you can cook the pasta immediately, dry it, refrigerate it, or freeze it at this point (see above)."

To cut the dough into fettuccine by hand, loosely fold/roll the dough into a cylinder, and cut with a sharp knife. Alternately, you can run the dough though the fettuccine cutter on your pasta machine."

Place the onions in the pan, drizzle with 1/4 cup of the olive oil and set over medium-high heat. Stir well and season with a couple pinches of salt. Theyâ€™ll cook down. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions start to color and begin to caramelize. I like to let them get super jammy, with lots of color, but not-at all burned. This can take about a half hour. Once youâ€™re nearly done cooking the onions, reduce the heat to low and stir in the garlic. Cook until soft, 5-6 minutes. You should end up with 2 or 2 1/2 cups of cooked onions. Set aside."

The top layer should have a some of everything. Add a finishing sprinkle of the remaining scallions and the chives. Drizzle with remaining 2 T. olive oil."
panade,"Bring the remaining 4 1/2 cups of broth to a simmer and taste for seasoning, it should taste good enough to drink. Pour it slowly over the panade, in doses, around the edges until it comes up nearly to the rim. Let it sit for a minute, allowing the bread to absorb the broth and add a bit more if needed."
panade,"Set the panade over low heat and bring to a simmer. Look for bubbling at the edges and listen to know. Remove from heat. Cover with a layer of parchment paper, then loosely wrap the top and sides of the pan with foil, careful because the pan can be hot. Place another piece of foil or sheet pan on the rack below your panade in case it bubbles over. Bake for about an hour, before having a peek. Baking time will actually depend on your pan and oven - it can take longer. Take a peek, at this point the top should be getting a bit golden around the edges. If youâ€™re not seeing any color, bake longer."
panade,"Uncover the panade, dial your oven to 375F, and bake until beautiful and golden on top, another 15-25 minutes. I sometimes give it a finishing kiss with the broiler if Iâ€™m not getting enough browning for my taste."
panade,"If youâ€™re not ready to serve, re-cover the panade, reduce the oven back to 250F, and you can hold it there for a half an hour or so without issue. You can always test the panade. Basically you want to avoid dryness. Your panade should be silky and unctuous. If it seems a bit on the dry side you can add more hot broth a few tablespoons at a time and serve when ready."

steaming-vegetables,"Wash your vegetables well, and cut them into bite-sized pieces. I tend to leave peels on, but it is a personal preference. Arrange them, in a single layer, in steamer trays according to needed cooking time. For example:"
steaming-vegetables,"Bottom tray: equal-sized chunks of slower-cooking vegetables. For example: sweet potato, potato, winter squash, beets. These usually cook through in about ten minutes. Middle-tray: equal sized pieces of broccoli, cauliflower.Â Top-tray/last minute: asparagus, fava beans (inner pods), snap peas."
steaming-vegetables,"Bring an inch of water to a simmer in a skillet large enough to accommodate the diameter of your steamer. Alternately, you can use a wok. The water should not be so high that it makes contact with the vegetables when the steamer is placed in the skillet - do a quick test if you're unsure, and remove some water if needed."
steaming-vegetables,"The goal here is to have your vegetables perfectly cooked and ready to serve just before you sit down. And, ideally, all of the vegetables finish cooking at the same time. Here's how you do it. Roughly ten minutes before you're ready to serve, place the slow-cooking, bottom tray vegetables over the simmering water, covered. Let them steam there until they're about 2/3 cooked, about 6-7 minutes. Test, and cut into any root vegetables toward the end to make sure they're going to be cooked through."
steaming-vegetables,"The mid tray only needs 3-4 minutes, so add that next, moving the lid up a level. And the top tray vegetables, like snap peas and asparagus, just need a kiss of steam to brighten, barely a minute. Add that last. Or if you only have two baskets, add these to the broccoli/cauliflower basket to finish. You'll have to make slight adjustments based on the sizes of your vegetables, but this is the general idea. Cook them until they're bright, just tender, and taste good to you."
steaming-vegetables,"I like to quickly arrange the steamed vegetables, nested, in one basket to serve along with a drizzle of good oil - toasted sesame, shallot, olive oil, herb, etc. With a sprinkle of flaky sea salt."

steaming-vegetables,"Wash your vegetables well, and cut them into bite-sized pieces. I tend to leave peels on, but it is a personal preference. Arrange them, in a single layer, in steamer trays according to needed cooking time. For example:"
steaming-vegetables,"Bottom tray: equal-sized chunks of slower-cooking vegetables. For example: sweet potato, potato, winter squash, beets. These usually cook through in about ten minutes. Middle-tray: equal sized pieces of broccoli, cauliflower.Â Top-tray/last minute: asparagus, fava beans (inner pods), snap peas."
steaming-vegetables,"Bring an inch of water to a simmer in a skillet large enough to accommodate the diameter of your steamer. Alternately, you can use a wok. The water should not be so high that it makes contact with the vegetables when the steamer is placed in the skillet - do a quick test if you're unsure, and remove some water if needed."
steaming-vegetables,"The goal here is to have your vegetables perfectly cooked and ready to serve just before you sit down. And, ideally, all of the vegetables finish cooking at the same time. Here's how you do it. Roughly ten minutes before you're ready to serve, place the slow-cooking, bottom tray vegetables over the simmering water, covered. Let them steam there until they're about 2/3 cooked, about 6-7 minutes. Test, and cut into any root vegetables toward the end to make sure they're going to be cooked through."
steaming-vegetables,"The mid tray only needs 3-4 minutes, so add that next, moving the lid up a level. And the top tray vegetables, like snap peas and asparagus, just need a kiss of steam to brighten, barely a minute. Add that last. Or if you only have two baskets, add these to the broccoli/cauliflower basket to finish. You'll have to make slight adjustments based on the sizes of your vegetables, but this is the general idea. Cook them until they're bright, just tender, and taste good to you."
steaming-vegetables,"I like to quickly arrange the steamed vegetables, nested, in one basket to serve along with a drizzle of good oil - toasted sesame, shallot, olive oil, herb, etc. With a sprinkle of flaky sea salt."

Be sure you get all the avocado near the skin, it's the best part. Sprinkle the avocado with the onions and garlic, and use a large fork to fold everything together. I like a chunky guacamole, so I tend to fold, chop with the edge of the fork, fold, chop. After a few folds add the lime juice, and fold some more. Taste and adjust with more salt or lime juice, and serve topped with cilantro and chives (or chive blossoms)."
guacamole,"You can store any uneaten guacamole in a refrigerator. Any surface area exposed to air will likely brown, so (preferably) use a glass jar (Weck) where the lid comes in contact with the avocado, or a piece of plastic wrap pressed to suface."

how-to-cook-artichokes,"Fill a bowl with water, squeeze the juice of the lemon into it. You'll add the artichokes to the water immediately after trimming."
how-to-cook-artichokes,"To trim your artichokes: Actually, before I get into the details of trimming, let's just establish what we're after. We're after the tender. Meaning, we want to trim any tough outer leaves, tips, and stem. We want to get down to the tender parts of the leaves, without trimming so much that we have little left. To start, trim the stem. Pull the outer leaves from the artichoke, until you get down to the more tender leaves. Cut off the top of the artichoke (roughly where it begins to taper in), you want to remove the tough part of the tips. I like to use a serrated knife for that cut. From here decide what shape you'd like your artichoke pieces to be. For this preparation, I cut each artichoke in halves, and/or quarters. If you are using larger artichokes, ones that have developed a fuzzy choke, you'll need to use a teaspoon (or mellon baller) to carve the fuzz out before moving on to your final cuts. Work efficiently, and get the trimmed artichokes in the lemon water as quickly as possible to reduce browning from oxidation."
how-to-cook-artichokes,"While prepping the artichokes, bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Salt well, and use a slotted spoon to transfer them from the lemon water to the boiling water. Boil until just tender, typically a minute or two. Drain well, and set aside. Alternately, you can steam the artichokes - this will keep more of the nutrients intact. Either way, you want the artichokes to be cooked tender (and feel free to eat them at this point)!"

best-pizza-dough-ever,"Stir together the flour, salt, and instant yeast in a 4-quart bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). With a large metal spoon, stir in the oil and the cold water until the flour is all absorbed (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment), If you are mixing by hand, repeatedly dip one of your hands or the metal spoon into cold water and use it, much like a dough hook, to work the dough vigorously into a smooth mass while rotating the bowl in a circular motion with the other hand. Reverse the circular motion a few times to develop the gluten further. Do this for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and the ingredients are evenly distributed. If you are using an electric mixer, switch to the dough hook and mix on medium speed for 5 to 7 minutes, or as long as it takes to create a smooth, sticky dough. The dough should clear the sides of the bowl but stick to the bottom of the bowl. If the dough is too wet and doesn't come off the sides of the bowl, sprinkle in some more flour just until it clears the sides. If it clears the bottom of the bowl, dribble in a teaspoon or two of cold water. The finished dough will be springy, elastic, and sticky, not just tacky, and register 50 to 55F."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"Sprinkle flour on the counter and transfer the dough to the counter. Prepare a sheet pan by lining it with baking parchment and misting the parchment with spray oil (or lightly oil the parchment). Using a metal dough scraper, cut the dough into 6 equal pieces (or larger if you are comfortable shaping large pizzas), You can dip the scraper into the water between cuts to keep the dough from sticking to it, Sprinkle flour over the dough. Make sure your hands are dry and then flour them. Lift each piece and gently round it into a ball. If the dough sticks to your hands, dip your hands into the flour again. Transfer the dough balls to the sheet pan, Mist the dough generously with spray oil and slip the pan into a food-grade plastic bag."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"Put the pan into the refrigerator overnight to rest the dough, or keep for up to 3 days. (Note: If you want to save some of the dough for future baking, you can store the dough balls in a zippered freezer bag. Dip each dough ball into a bowl that has a few tablespoons of oil in it, rolling the dough in the oil, and then put each ball into a separate bag. You can place the bags into the freezer for up to 3 months. Transfer them to the refrigerator the day before you plan to make pizza.)"
best-pizza-dough-ever,"On the day you plan to make the pizza, remove the desired number of dough balls from the refrigerator 2 hours before making the pizza. Before letting the dough rest at room temperature for 2 hours, dust the counter with flour, and then mist the counter with spray oil. Place the dough balls on top of the floured counter and sprinkle them with flour; dust your hands with flour. Gently press the dough into flat disks about 1/2 inch thick and 5 inches in diameter. Sprinkle the dough with flour, mist it again with spray oil, and cover the dough loosely with plastic wrap or a food-grade plastic bag. Now let rest for 2 hours."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"At least 45 minutes before making the pizza, place a baking stone either on the floor of the oven (for gas ovens), or on a rack in the lower third of the oven. Heat the oven as hot as possible, up to 800F (most home ovens will go only to 500 to 550F, but some will go higher). If you do not have a baking stone, you can use the back of a sheet pan, but do not preheat the pan."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"Generously dust a peel or the back of a sheet pan with semolina flour or cornmeal. Make the pizzas one at a time. Dip your hands, including the backs of your hands and knuckles, in flour and lift I piece of dough by getting under it with a pastry scraper. Very gently lay the dough across your fists and carefully stretch it by bouncing the dough in a circular motion on your hands, carefully giving it a little stretch with each bounce. If it begins to stick to your hands, lay it down on the floured counter and reflour your hands, then continue shaping it. If you have trouble tossing the dough, or if the dough keeps springing back, let it rest for 5 to 20 minutes so the gluten can relax, and try again. You can also resort to using a rolling pin, though this isn't as effective."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"When the dough is stretched out to your satisfaction (about 9 to 12 inches in diameter for a 6-ounce piece of dough), lay it on the peel or pan, making sure there is enough semolina flour or cornmeal to allow it to slide. Lightly top it with sauce and then with your other toppings, remembering that the best pizzas are topped with a less-is-more philosophy. The American ""kitchen sink"" approach is counterproductive, as it makes the crust more difficult to bake. A few, usually no more than 3 or 4 toppings, including sauce and cheese is sufficient."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"Slide the topped pizza onto the stone (or bake directly on the sheet pan) and close the door. Wait 2 minutes, then take a peek. If it needs to be rotated 180 degrees for even baking, do so. The pizza should take about 5 to 8 minutes to bake. If the top gets done before the bottom, you will need to move the stone to a lower self before the next round. if the bottom crisps before the cheese caramelizes, then you will need to raise the stone for subsequent bakes."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"Remove the pizza from the oven and transfer to a cutting board. Wait 3 to 5 minutes before slicing and serving, to allow the cheese to set slightly."

Meaning, we want to trim any tough outer leaves, tips, and stem. We want to get down to the tender parts of the leaves, without trimming so much that we have little left. To start, trim the stem. Pull the outer leaves from the artichoke, until you get down to the more tender leaves. Cut off the top of the artichoke (roughly where it begins to taper in), you want to remove the tough part of the tips. I like to use a serrated knife for that cut. From here decide what shape you'd like your artichoke pieces to be. For this preparation, I cut each artichoke in halves, and/or quarters. If you are using larger artichokes, ones that have developed a fuzzy choke, you'll need to use a teaspoon (or mellon baller) to carve the fuzz out before moving on to your final cuts. Work efficiently, and get the trimmed artichokes in the lemon water as quickly as possible to reduce browning from oxidation."

Middle-tray: equal sized pieces of broccoli, cauliflower.Â Top-tray/last minute: asparagus, fava beans (inner pods), snap peas."
steaming-vegetables,"Bring an inch of water to a simmer in a skillet large enough to accommodate the diameter of your steamer. Alternately, you can use a wok. The water should not be so high that it makes contact with the vegetables when the steamer is placed in the skillet - do a quick test if you're unsure, and remove some water if needed."
steaming-vegetables,"The goal here is to have your vegetables perfectly cooked and ready to serve just before you sit down. And, ideally, all of the vegetables finish cooking at the same time. Here's how you do it. Roughly ten minutes before you're ready to serve, place the slow-cooking, bottom tray vegetables over the simmering water, covered. Let them steam there until they're about 2/3 cooked, about 6-7 minutes. Test, and cut into any root vegetables toward the end to make sure they're going to be cooked through."
steaming-vegetables,"The mid tray only needs 3-4 minutes, so add that next, moving the lid up a level. And the top tray vegetables, like snap peas and asparagus, just need a kiss of steam to brighten, barely a minute. Add that last. Or if you only have two baskets, add these to the broccoli/cauliflower basket to finish. You'll have to make slight adjustments based on the sizes of your vegetables, but this is the general idea. Cook them until they're bright, just tender, and taste good to you."

tomato-tart,"Next up is making the tart dough. If youâ€™re used to the typical food processor tart dough method, this is going to be different, but the resulting texture is so much better - flaky perfection. If the instructions are at all confusingÂ you can watch the method here. I learned the technique from Pim years ago and never looked back. Also, you donâ€™t have to wash a food processor = less dishes. To start, mix the flours, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and quinoa in a bowl and turn out onto the counter. Working quickly, cut the butter into four long slabs and arrange in a single layer across the surface of the flour. Hold a bench scraper (or wide metal spatula) in one hand, and use the palm of your other hand to smear the butter into the flour. Use the bench scraper to scrape the smeared flour-butter off the counter and back up into the pile. Use your palm to smear some more, scrape, and repeat. You want lots of feathery flakes throughout the flour. Drizzle the mixture with the ice water and smear, flip, and mix a few more times to bring it all together into a ball. Decide how many tarts youâ€™d like to bake, and cut into that many equal pieces (1, 2, or 4). Shape into balls, press into discs, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 45 minutes or over night. You can also double wrap and freeze for up to a month or so at this point, thaw before using."
tomato-tart,"When youâ€™re ready to assemble your tart(s), preheat the oven to 400F with a rack in the center.  Roll your dough out into a 1/8-inch thick circle shape on a floured surface, it doesn't have to be perfect. Transfer the rolled out dough to a piece of parchment paper. Arrange a generous amount of the onions in the center of your tart(s) leaving an inch-ish of border. Cover the onions with overlapping sliced tomatoes, then fold the tart dough in toward the filling, over lapping it just a bit. Brush any visible pasty with the beaten egg. Transfer, on the parchment paper, to a baking sheet and bake for 25-30 minutes or until the crust is deeply golden."

best-pizza-dough-ever,"Stir together the flour, salt, and instant yeast in a 4-quart bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). With a large metal spoon, stir in the oil and the cold water until the flour is all absorbed (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment), If you are mixing by hand, repeatedly dip one of your hands or the metal spoon into cold water and use it, much like a dough hook, to work the dough vigorously into a smooth mass while rotating the bowl in a circular motion with the other hand. Reverse the circular motion a few times to develop the gluten further. Do this for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and the ingredients are evenly distributed. If you are using an electric mixer, switch to the dough hook and mix on medium speed for 5 to 7 minutes, or as long as it takes to create a smooth, sticky dough. The dough should clear the sides of the bowl but stick to the bottom of the bowl. If the dough is too wet and doesn't come off the sides of the bowl, sprinkle in some more flour just until it clears the sides. If it clears the bottom of the bowl, dribble in a teaspoon or two of cold water. The finished dough will be springy, elastic, and sticky, not just tacky, and register 50 to 55F."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"Sprinkle flour on the counter and transfer the dough to the counter. Prepare a sheet pan by lining it with baking parchment and misting the parchment with spray oil (or lightly oil the parchment). Using a metal dough scraper, cut the dough into 6 equal pieces (or larger if you are comfortable shaping large pizzas), You can dip the scraper into the water between cuts to keep the dough from sticking to it, Sprinkle flour over the dough. Make sure your hands are dry and then flour them. Lift each piece and gently round it into a ball. If the dough sticks to your hands, dip your hands into the flour again. Transfer the dough balls to the sheet pan, Mist the dough generously with spray oil and slip the pan into a food-grade plastic bag."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"Put the pan into the refrigerator overnight to rest the dough, or keep for up to 3 days. (Note: If you want to save some of the dough for future baking, you can store the dough balls in a zippered freezer bag. Dip each dough ball into a bowl that has a few tablespoons of oil in it, rolling the dough in the oil, and then put each ball into a separate bag. You can place the bags into the freezer for up to 3 months. Transfer them to the refrigerator the day before you plan to make pizza.)"
best-pizza-dough-ever,"On the day you plan to make the pizza, remove the desired number of dough balls from the refrigerator 2 hours before making the pizza. Before letting the dough rest at room temperature for 2 hours, dust the counter with flour, and then mist the counter with spray oil. Place the dough balls on top of the floured counter and sprinkle them with flour; dust your hands with flour. Gently press the dough into flat disks about 1/2 inch thick and 5 inches in diameter. Sprinkle the dough with flour, mist it again with spray oil, and cover the dough loosely with plastic wrap or a food-grade plastic bag. Now let rest for 2 hours."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"At least 45 minutes before making the pizza, place a baking stone either on the floor of the oven (for gas ovens), or on a rack in the lower third of the oven. Heat the oven as hot as possible, up to 800F (most home ovens will go only to 500 to 550F, but some will go higher). If you do not have a baking stone, you can use the back of a sheet pan, but do not preheat the pan."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"Generously dust a peel or the back of a sheet pan with semolina flour or cornmeal. Make the pizzas one at a time. Dip your hands, including the backs of your hands and knuckles, in flour and lift I piece of dough by getting under it with a pastry scraper. Very gently lay the dough across your fists and carefully stretch it by bouncing the dough in a circular motion on your hands, carefully giving it a little stretch with each bounce. If it begins to stick to your hands, lay it down on the floured counter and reflour your hands, then continue shaping it. If you have trouble tossing the dough, or if the dough keeps springing back, let it rest for 5 to 20 minutes so the gluten can relax, and try again. You can also resort to using a rolling pin, though this isn't as effective."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"When the dough is stretched out to your satisfaction (about 9 to 12 inches in diameter for a 6-ounce piece of dough), lay it on the peel or pan, making sure there is enough semolina flour or cornmeal to allow it to slide. Lightly top it with sauce and then with your other toppings, remembering that the best pizzas are topped with a less-is-more philosophy. The American ""kitchen sink"" approach is counterproductive, as it makes the crust more difficult to bake. A few, usually no more than 3 or 4 toppings, including sauce and cheese is sufficient."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"Slide the topped pizza onto the stone (or bake directly on the sheet pan) and close the door. Wait 2 minutes, then take a peek. If it needs to be rotated 180 degrees for even baking, do so. The pizza should take about 5 to 8 minutes to bake. If the top gets done before the bottom, you will need to move the stone to a lower self before the next round. if the bottom crisps before the cheese caramelizes, then you will need to raise the stone for subsequent bakes."
best-pizza-dough-ever,"Remove the pizza from the oven and transfer to a cutting board. Wait 3 to 5 minutes before slicing and serving, to allow the cheese to set slightly."

Keep a close eye on the whole baking process, the granola can burn in a flash, and itâ€™s hard to see it toasting because it is so dark from the cocoa.

archives/zucchini-ricotta-cheesecake-recipe.html,"In a strainer, toss the shredded zucchini with the salt and let sit for ten minutes. Now aggressively squeeze and press out as much moisture as you can. Then squeeze some more. Set aside."
archives/zucchini-ricotta-cheesecake-recipe.html,"In the meantime, combine the ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, shallots, garlic, dill and lemon zest in a medium bowl. Stir in the eggs and continue mixing until well combined. Now stir in the shredded zucchini. Fill the springform pan with the ricotta mixture and place on a baking sheet. Place in the oven and bake for sixty minutes. If there is any moisture left on top of the cake at this point, carefully use a bit of paper towel to dab it off. Now sprinkle with the goat cheese and return to the oven for another 20 to 30 minutes or until the goat cheese is melted and the cake barely jiggles in the center (it will set up more as it cools)."
archives/zucchini-ricotta-cheesecake-recipe.html,"At this point, if the cake is baked and set, but the top isn't quite golden, I'll zap it with the broiler (just about a minute) to get a bit more color on top. Remove from the oven and let cool five minutes, then release the cake from its pan. Cool completely, serve at room temperature drizzled with a bit of olive oil and a few sprigs of dill."
