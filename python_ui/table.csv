You just want to warm this for a few minutes, to get the ginger, garlic, and scallions to sweat a bit. Combine the ginger, turmeric, seeds, red pepper flakes, and paprika with the sesame and sunflower oil in a small saucepan over very gentle heat. Bring barely to a simmer. Stir constantly for a minute, remove from heat and add the sake, brown sugar, and miso. Return to heat, and allow the flavors to combine, stirring constantly for another thirty seconds or so. Toss whatever raw vegetables you're using with the Spicy Turmeric Oil, and divide them between bowls. Cook the noodles according to package, and divide into four bowls. Gently heat the cashew milk (if serving hot), just until very hot (not simmering). Stir some of the milk into the 3 tablespoons of Miso Tare to thin it out, and then add it back to the cashew milk. Taste, and add more Miso Tare if needed. The broth should taste great at this point!Â "
